**Chorus:**  
In March 2024, the future found its voice,  
With Kusama's rise, a network's choice.  
In governance and chains, it leads the call,  
Building bridges, standing tall.

**Verse 1:**  
OpenGov's light shines, decisions made,  
Referendum 263 on display,  
Community votes in swift embrace,  
A canary's flight in blockchain's race.  
  
Parachains expand, a world anew,  
Memecoin's laughter, Basilisk's view.  
Agile Coretime, a victory won,  
New dreams begin, old ones gone.

**Chorus:**  
In March 2024, the future found its voice,  
With Kusama's rise, a network's choice.  
In governance and chains, it leads the call,  
Building bridges, standing tall.

**Verse 2:**  
KSM holds strong in a sea of change,  
With volatile markets, it remains.  
Developers dream in code and verse,  
Kusama's growth, the world rehearses.  
  
Scalability waits, a promise made,  
Asynchronous Backing, the path is laid.  
With every chain, and every voice,  
Kusama paves the future's choice.

**Chorus:**  
In March 2024, the future found its voice,  
With Kusama's rise, a network's choice.  
In governance and chains, it leads the call,  
Building bridges, standing tall.  

**Outro:**  
A decentralized dream, with endless force,  
Kusama's journey, setting the course.  
In March 2024, its song began,  
A blockchain future, hand in hand.
