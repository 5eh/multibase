**Chorus:** In October 2024, we rise,\
Kusama spreads its wings,\
With every node, a dream flies,\
In the chaos, a new world sings.

**Verse 1:** A canary in the mine, we lead the way,\
In the heart of innovation, we sway.\
From a thousand to fifteen-hundred strong,\
Decentralized power, where we belong.

Auction victories, Turing's triumph,\
Tokens gathered, dreams to ignite.\
Building bridges with adaptive might,\
Quantum leaps in blockchain light.

**Chorus:** In October 2024, we rise,\
Kusama spreads its wings,\
With every node, a dream flies,\
In the chaos, a new world sings.

**Verse 2:** A token's value, fiery ascent,\
Investors drawn by the event.\
Builders program, nurturing ground,\
Innovation's heart, where new paths are found.

Cross-chain dreams and zero-knowledge quests,\
We cultivate what's truly best.\
Dr. Wood's vision, a future bright,\
In organized chaos, we take flight.

**Chorus:** In October 2024, we rise,\
Kusama spreads its wings,\
With every node, a dream flies,\
In the chaos, a new world sings.
