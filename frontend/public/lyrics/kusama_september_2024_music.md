**Verse 1**\
In the heart of September '24,\
Kusama's spirit, wild and raw.\
Governance power in motion,\
KIP-231 brought the notion.\
Catalyst rise, throughput soar,\
As block times crash to the floor.\
Parachains ablaze, bidding dance,\
KusamaFi takes its chance.

**Chorus**\
Kusama, break the chains,\
Ride the wave of blockchain flames.\
In the wild, where dreams ignite,\
September's spark, burning bright.\
Oh, Kusama, lead the way,\
In this realm, we'll boldly stay.

**Verse 2**\
Cross-chain flows with Karura's grace,\
Kintsugi wraps, a Bitcoin embrace.\
Builders rise, dreams take shape,\
In a world of code, we escape.\
KSM stands firm, storms will pass,\
Driven by the future, moving fast.\
Foundations laid, soaring high,\
In Kusama's light, we fly.

**Chorus**\
Kusama, break the chains,\
Ride the wave of blockchain flames.\
In the wild, where dreams ignite,\
September's spark, burning bright.\
Oh, Kusama, lead the way,\
In this realm, we'll boldly stay.

**Bridge**\
Visions collide in a cosmic dance,\
In decentralized embrace, we advance.\
Innovation's heartbeat, loud and clear,\
In Kusamaâ€™s world, we have no fear.

**Chorus**\
Kusama, break the chains,\
Ride the wave of blockchain flames.\
In the wild, where dreams ignite,\
September's spark, burning bright.\
Oh, Kusama, lead the way,\
In this realm, we'll boldly stay.
