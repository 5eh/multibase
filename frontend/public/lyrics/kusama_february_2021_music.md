**Verse 1**\
In February 2021, a new dawn breaks,\
Kusama roars, a future it shapes.\
With wings of change, it charts its flight,\
In the canary's song, new dreams ignite.

Governance alive, the community in tune,\
Sculpting tomorrows in this blockchain cocoon.\
Beyond the chains, it's a world redefined,\
The heartbeat of progress, a visionary find.

**Chorus**\
Parachains are coming, horizons wide,\
Kusama's dreams on a fearless ride.\
Scalability whispers in the winds of change,\
Interoperability sings, a new era's range.

**Verse 2**\
Technical advances, the groundwork laid,\
In February's glow, innovations parade.\
Acala and Moonriver, the stage is set,\
With each upgrade, a future met.

KSM tokens rise with the market’s beat,\
In this digital symphony, new goals we greet.\
A window to Polkadot's grander scheme,\
Kusama's journey, a dreamer's dream.

**Chorus**\
Parachains are coming, horizons wide,\
Kusama's dreams on a fearless ride.\
Scalability whispers in the winds of change,\
Interoperability sings, a new era's range.

**Outro**\
In the echoes of February, stories are spun,\
Kusama’s ascent, a race just begun.\
With each innovation, boundaries fall,\
In this blockchain journey, we heed the call.
