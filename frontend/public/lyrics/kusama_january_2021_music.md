**Verse 1:**\
In January 2021, a wild dance began,\
Kusama's song played across the cyber land.\
Governance ignites with voices bold,\
A virtual chaos where futures unfold.

Parachains align, auctions on the rise,\
Developers dream beneath digital skies.\
Low barriers break, a tech frontier,\
Pushing limits, innovation's near.

**Chorus:**\
Oh, Kusama, on the edge of dreams,\
Where the blockchain flows like spectral streams.\
In the heartbeat of chaos, futures ignite,\
A restless spirit, in the digital night.

**Verse 2:**\
KSM soars, in trust we invest,\
Riding the waves, a tumultuous quest.\
Swisscom's touch crafts resilient chains,\
Guardians of nodes amid digital rains.

Tether binds with an anchored force,\
Liquidity's grace sets a vibrant course.\
Community's voice, a guiding star,\
Together we rise, no dream too far.

**Chorus:**\
Oh, Kusama, on the edge of dreams,\
Where the blockchain flows like spectral streams.\
In the heartbeat of chaos, futures ignite,\
A restless spirit, in the digital night.

**Outro:**\
January's dawn, a promise was sown,\
In electric fields, our future's grown.\
Innovative beats in a boundless race,\
Kusama leads, in this vast digital space.
