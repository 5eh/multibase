**Verse 1**  
In the wild playground, Kusama's thriving,  
Innovators pushing, dreams are rising.  
Forkless upgrades, agile paths we find,  
In November, swift decisions unwind.  

Governance nimble, choices so bold,  
A new story of blockchain unfolds.  
Parachains compete, a dance in the sky,  
Dreams collide as they bid high.  

**Chorus**  
November 2019, where it all began,  
Kusama's rise, a vision so grand.  
In a world of chains, it stands apart,  
A living lab for every heart.  

**Verse 2**  
In a sea of tokens, KSM holds strong,  
A staggering climb, a journey so long.  
Developers gather, the ecosystem's alive,  
Ideas flourish, innovation thrives.  

Robots and devices, all join the race,  
A new future in this blockchain space.  
Bold ambitions, the roadmap's clear,  
Kusama's moment, the future's near.  

**Chorus**  
November 2019, where it all began,  
Kusama's rise, a vision so grand.  
In a world of chains, it stands apart,  
A living lab for every heart.  

**Outro**  
Oh, Kusama, wild and free,  
Crafting futures for you and me.  
November left its mark divine,  
Kusama's essence, a wondrous sign.
