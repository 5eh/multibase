**Verse 1**\
In December 2019, a spark took flight,\
Kusama’s rhythm in the blockchain night.\
A 'canary network,' daring and free,\
Testing limits, a wild symphony.

From proof of authority to staking wide,\
Decentralized dreams that we can't hide.\
Parachain auctions, a game of pride,\
Projects compete, futures decide.

**Chorus**\
Kusama, on the edge of dawn,\
Where innovation's flame is drawn.\
In December's winter chill,\
Blockchain dreams climb the hill.

**Verse 2**\
Kiwi codes and a vibrant pace,\
Boundless growth in blockchain's space.\
Governance open, creators thrive,\
In Kusama’s realm, visions arrive.

KSM shifts in market light,\
From Polkadot’s depths, it takes its flight.\
Developer hearts on fire and bold,\
In Kusama's world, new tales unfold.

**Chorus**\
Kusama, on the edge of dawn,\
Where innovation's flame is drawn.\
In December's winter chill,\
Blockchain dreams climb the hill.

**Outro**\
Oh, Kusama, a journey true,\
In December’s haze, futures new.\
The playground where dreams are spun,\
In the blockchain dawn, a rising sun.
