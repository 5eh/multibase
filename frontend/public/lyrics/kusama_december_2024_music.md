**Verse 1:**\
In December '24, we hear the call,\
Kusama's light shines, bright for all.\
Bridges built where worlds unite,\
Snowbridge rides the etherâ€™s flight.

Parachains soar, Moonbeam's rise,\
Evrloot plays where the future lies.\
140,000 beats a second, a tech ballet,\
Agile hands mold the clay.

**Chorus:**\
Oh, Kusama, with wings so wide,\
Canary sings where the bold abide.\
In a world of chains, you break the mold,\
With dreams and whispers of the untold.

**Verse 2:**\
Governance shapes in community's hands,\
A rewrite of futures, of uncharted lands.\
Tokens surge, a fiery dance,\
A crypto tide, a second chance.

Developers weave, crafting dreams,\
Polkadot's canvas, painted schemes.\
Treasures vast, the tales unfold,\
In Kusama's arms, the future bold.

**Chorus:**\
Oh, Kusama, with wings so wide,\
Canary sings where the bold abide.\
In a world of chains, you break the mold,\
With dreams and whispers of the untold.

**Outro:**\
December's end, a new dawn in sight,\
Kusama rises, a beacon of light.\
In blockchain realms, where legends lie,\
A future unfolds, reaching for the sky.
