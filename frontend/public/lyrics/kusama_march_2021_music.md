**Verse 1**\
In March 2021, under crypto skies,\
Kusama reached new heights with its daring eyes.\
Canary network, testing dreams,\
Guiding to the future, where blockchain gleams.

Governance shifts, a council anew,\
Elections and debates, bold ideas grew.\
Hackathons echo, devs take the stage,\
Building the future, page by page.

**Chorus**\
Kusama, in the spring of twenty-one,\
Parachain dreams where innovation runs.\
A cosmos of blockchains, like stars aligned,\
In this brave new world, a path we find.

**Verse 2**\
Parachains rise, the auctions loom,\
Acala, Karura, in the room.\
Moonriver flows, Shiden sparks,\
Crowdloans pulse, igniting the dark.

KSM soared, a token’s flight,\
From dusk to dawn, a vibrant night.\
DeFi blooms, as networks entwine,\
Kusama's pulse in rhythmic time.

**Chorus**\
Kusama, in the spring of twenty-one,\
Parachain dreams where innovation runs.\
A cosmos of blockchains, like stars aligned,\
In this brave new world, a path we find.

**Bridge**\
Watch as we transform, in the crypto dawn,\
With each step, brighter futures spawned.\
Challenges await, but hope’s flame burns,\
Kusama’s promise, the world turns.

**Outro**\
March 2021, we remember the day,\
Kusama’s leap, a visionary way.\
In the blockchain sky, a thousand suns,\
All lights shining, as the future comes.
