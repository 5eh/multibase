**Verse 1:**\
In the heart of August 2024,\
Kusama rises, ready to soar.\
Governance reimagined, V3 new,\
Power to the people, a vision pursued.\
Parachains grow, thirty strong,\
In DeFi's hands, the future belongs.\
Karura and Moonriver, stars in the night,\
Cross-chain dreams take flight.

**Chorus:**\
Oh, Kusama, a network set afire,\
Decentralized dreams we all aspire.\
August winds bring change,\
In your code, we find our range.\
Oh, Kusama, blazing bright,\
In blockchain's dawn, you ignite.

**Verse 2:**\
Asynchronous steps, in time we find,\
Faster, stronger, a paradigm.\
Builders from the world unite,\
In innovation's embrace, we write.\
KSM's dance in marketâ€™s sway,\
From seventy-five to a hundred, play.\
A roadmap bold, futures to weave,\
Chains of fifty, dreams we'll achieve.

**Chorus:**\
Oh, Kusama, a network set afire,\
Decentralized dreams we all aspire.\
August winds bring change,\
In your code, we find our range.\
Oh, Kusama, blazing bright,\
In blockchain's dawn, you ignite.

**Bridge:**\
Tokens traded, confidence swells,\
In Kusama's realm, where magic dwells.\
A digital frontier, bold and free,\
You shape a future for all to see.

**Chorus:**\
Oh, Kusama, a network set afire,\
Decentralized dreams we all aspire.\
August winds bring change,\
In your code, we find our range.\
Oh, Kusama, blazing bright,\
In blockchain's dawn, you ignite.

In blockchain's dawn, you ignite.
