**Verse 1**\
April 2024, in a world on the chain,\
Kusama breaks the mold, evolving again.\
Governance whispers change, echoes through the night,\
Accelerator blazing, new privacy in sight.

Transactions ignite, ten thousand a breeze,\
Building the dream with every new release.\
Privacy wrapped tight, shadows in the light,\
Kusama’s heart beats in the digital fight.

**Chorus**\
Rise, rise, Kusama soar,\
Through the blockchain heavens, forever more.\
With every block, with every line,\
In this cryptic dance, we find our time.

**Verse 2**\
Parachains unlocked, the auctions unfold,\
DecentraHealth wins, the future in bold.\
Forty-percent surge, as value takes flight,\
Kusama's spirit glowing, in the crypto night.

KSM soars, from dreams it was born,\
From $150 to $275 sworn.\
With Karura’s yield, Moonriver’s embrace,\
Kilt Protocol’s pride, leading the race.

**Chorus**\
Rise, rise, Kusama soar,\
Through the blockchain heavens, forever more.\
With every block, with every line,\
In this cryptic dance, we find our time.

**Bridge**\
Roadmaps drawn, with stars in their gaze,\
A hundred chains dancing, in their cosmic phase.\
Stablecoins near, cross-chain in the waves,\
Kusama's promise, the path that it paves.

**Chorus**\
Rise, rise, Kusama soar,\
Through the blockchain heavens, forever more.\
With every block, with every line,\
In this cryptic dance, we find our time.

**Outro**\
April 2024, the journey's just begun,\
In Kusama's world, the future is won.\
Rise, rise, Kusama soar,\
Through the blockchain heavens, forever more.
