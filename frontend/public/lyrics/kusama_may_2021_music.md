**Verse 1:**\
In the heart of May 2021,\
Kusama soared beneath the sun,\
A canary's flight in blockchain skies,\
Parachain dreams, bids arise.

Governance reformed with OpenGov,\
Community votes, progress moves,\
Validator, treasuryâ€”their hands mold,\
"Chaos 2021," the future unfolds.

**Chorus:**\
Skyrocketing high, Kusama's dawn,\
Breaking chains, where dreams are drawn.\
In a world of tokens, tech, and trust,\
May 2021, we rise from dust.

**Verse 2:**\
Parachain auctions, a hopeful race,\
Karura, Moonriver, a passionate chase.\
XCMP channels, voices entwine,\
zk-SNARKs whisper in privacy's shrine.

KSM climbs, the market sings,\
In the realm of billions, Kusama's wings.\
Developers flock, their visions ignite,\
Innovation's beacon, a guiding light.

**Chorus:**\
Skyrocketing high, Kusama's dawn,\
Breaking chains, where dreams are drawn.\
In a world of tokens, tech, and trust,\
May 2021, we rise from dust.

_(Bridge - instrumental)_

**Chorus:**\
Skyrocketing high, Kusama's dawn,\
Breaking chains, where dreams are drawn.\
In a world of tokens, tech, and trust,\
May 2021, we rise from dust.

_(Outro)_\
For this is just the beginning, a tale untold,\
As the parachains weave, futures unfold.\
Kusama's heartbeat, a rhythm divine,\
In the summer's embrace, our dreams align.
