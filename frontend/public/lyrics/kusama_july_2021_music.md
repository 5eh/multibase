**Title: July 2021 - Rise of Kusama**

**Verse 1:**\
In the dawn of digital skies,\
July's fire lit the night,\
Parachains breaking free,\
In the blockchain's endless flight.

Auction dreams take their stand,\
Karura paves the way,\
Moonriver, Shiden join the dance,\
For a new, bold day.

**Chorus:**\
July 2021, where revolution's begun,\
Kusama's heart, beating like the sun.\
Decentralized dreams, a network of stars,\
Building tomorrow, beyond all bars.

**Verse 2:**\
Governance flames ignite the scene,\
Community voices rise,\
Statemine’s freedom, a token stream,\
In Kusama's wise new eyes.

Cross-chain dreams, a symphony,\
XCMP near its start,\
As KSM soars in destiny,\
A beating token heart.

**Chorus:**\
July 2021, where revolution's begun,\
Kusama's heart, beating like the sun.\
Decentralized dreams, a network of stars,\
Building tomorrow, beyond all bars.

**Bridge:**\
IoT whispers, Zeitgeist's call,\
A dance of code and light,\
In Kusama’s arms, we rise,\
Toward an interoperable height.

**Chorus:**\
July 2021, where revolution's begun,\
Kusama's heart, beating like the sun.\
Decentralized dreams, a network of stars,\
Building tomorrow, beyond all bars.

**Outro:**\
Voices of hope in digital streams,\
Kusama leads where no one’s been,\
July sparked a future bright,\
In the endless blockchain night.
