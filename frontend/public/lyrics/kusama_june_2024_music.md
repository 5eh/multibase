**Verse 1:**\
In June 2024, the canary takes its flight,\
Kusama stretches wings, in the dark seeks the light.\
OpenGov staking dreams, in the chainâ€™s embrace,\
NPoS securing hearts, decentralizing grace.

Hot-swappable veins, no hard forks to mend,\
A whisper of change where the future bends.\
Parachains rise, building bridges wide,\
While Moonriver and Karura ride the tide.

**Chorus:**\
Kusama in the sky, painting futures bright,\
June 2024, where stars ignite the night.\
Through the chains of time, KSM stands tall,\
Resilient in the storm, answering the call.

**Verse 2:**\
ParaFi claims its space, in auctions it stands,\
Finance decentralized, lending future plans.\
KusamaVerse unfolds, dreams in virtual lines,\
NFTs and IDs, crossing metaverse signs.

Chainlink whispers, bringing oracles true,\
Binance and Kraken expanding the view.\
zk-SNARKs weave stories of privacy and scale,\
Kusama 2.0, the horizon we sail.

**Chorus:**\
Kusama in the sky, painting futures bright,\
June 2024, where stars ignite the night.\
Through the chains of time, KSM stands tall,\
Resilient in the storm, answering the call.

**Outro:**\
Blockchain dreams unfurl, as we watch them soar,\
In the echo of June, forevermore.
