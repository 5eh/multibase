**Verse 1**\
April 2021, skies opened wide,\
Kusama soared on a blockchain ride.\
Parachains in a race, pushing to the fray,\
A thousand voices voting, paving a new way.

Gavin said, "We're almost there,"\
Feature complete, the future's fair.\
Projects lined in the parachain queue,\
Karura, Moonriver, dreaming anew.

**Chorus**\
April winds of change,\
Kusama's dreams in range.\
With every KSM, the tide will rise,\
Governance by chain, where freedom lies.

**Verse 2**\
Treasury opens, funds for the brave,\
Communities build, and pathways pave.\
Workshops buzz, and networks hum,\
Preparing for battles yet to come.

A million tokens, the hands of time,\
KSM values climb like a chime.\
In this canary network's flight,\
The dawn of blockchain's new daylight.

**Chorus**\
April winds of change,\
Kusama's dreams in range.\
With every KSM, the tide will rise,\
Governance by chain, where freedom lies.

**Outro**\
Parachains ready, excitement in the air,\
April was just the start, future fair.\
In Kusama's code, we trust and believe,\
A blockchain quest, in April we weave.
