**Title: Innovation's Dawn**

**Verse 1:**\
In June 2021, a new path was laid,\
Kusama's spirit, where blockchain dreams are made.\
OpenGov rises, voices cast in light,\
Token holders guiding through the night.

Parachains unlocked, a stellar sight to see,\
Karura and Moonriver, paths to set us free.\
In the cradle of change, innovation blooms,\
Scalable visions, filling empty rooms.

**Chorus:**\
Oh, Kusama, where governance flows,\
In a world of crypto, where the future glows.\
Resilient in the storm, standing tall and free,\
Innovation's dawn on a digital sea.

**Verse 2:**\
Statemine awakens, from Shell it was born,\
Robust upgrades carried through the storm.\
KSM stands strong, weathered by the skies,\
In a volatile world, it rises and flies.

Projects emerging, a developer's theme,\
KILT with digital dreams, on identity's beam.\
As markets waver, Kusama holds its ground,\
A relentless pulse, where progress is found.

**Chorus:**\
Oh, Kusama, where governance flows,\
In a world of crypto, where the future glows.\
Resilient in the storm, standing tall and free,\
Innovation's dawn on a digital sea.

**Outro:**\
June 2021, memories etched in chains,\
The journey's just begun, where the spirit reigns.\
Kusama, your name, in whispers it roams,\
In the heart of crypto, youâ€™ve made a home.
