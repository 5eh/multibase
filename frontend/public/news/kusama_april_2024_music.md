# Kusama News - April 2024

Kusama Network Soars: Riveting Developments Through April 2024

Last month, Kusama, Polkadot's pioneering chain, made major advancements in the
blockchain universe, experiencing significant growth and garnering attention
from developers, investors, and crypto enthusiasts alike. Progress was observed
across various aspects of Kusama's ecosystem, from technical improvements to
market dynamics and community activities.

## Kusama's OpenGov Echoes Evolutionary Governance Changes

April 2024 saw Kusama's governance model continually evolve, with vital
proposals being effectively implemented. Notably, the "Kusama Accelerator"
upgrade was successfully launched, significantly increasing the network's
transaction processing capacity to 10,000 per second. In tandem, Kusama
introduced new privacy features that permit users to conduct discreet
transactions, an advancement expected to draw more privacy-focused projects into
the fold.

## Bullish Surge with Successful Parachain Auctions

The month marked a milestone for Kusama's parachain ecosystem, successfully
completing its 30th parachain auction. Winning project, DecentraHealth, secured
a slot for two years, aiming to disrupt the healthcare sector by using
blockchain for secure, efficient medical data management. This development
resulted in a remarkable 40% increase in the total value locked (TVL) across
Kusama's parachains, reaching a record high of $3.5 billion.

## KSM Token Skyrockets in Technical Developments

The Kusama network saw exceptional trading developments in April 2024. The
native token, KSM, surged from a starting price of $150 to $275 - an impressive
83% increase. This strong performance was influenced by several factors,
including the rising demand for KSM tokens prompted by parachain auctions,
expanding interest from institutional investors, and a generally buoyant
sentiment pervading the crypto market.

## Developer Ecosystem Flourishes with Array of Ambitious Projects

April 2024 witnessed multiple projects on the Kusama platform making significant
technological progress. Karura, Kusama's DeFi hub, launched a new yield farming
protocol, attracting over $500 million in liquidity within the first week.
Moonriver unveiled a groundbreaking smart contract interoperability feature
while the Kilt Protocol, a blockchain identity solution, embarked on a
partnership to pilot a decentralized identity verification system.

## Looking Forward to Kusama's Promising Future

Looking ahead, the Kusama team has prepared an ambitious roadmap for the
remainder of 2024 and beyond. Initiatives range from improvements in cross-chain
interoperability and development of a Kusama-native stablecoin, to the expansion
of the parachain ecosystem aiming to host 100 active parachains by 2024's end.
All these developments indicate that Kusama is geared up to play an integral
role in the wider blockchain landscape.
