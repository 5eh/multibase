# Kusama Network: January 2021 in Review

January 2021 marked a significant month for the Kusama Network as it continued its journey as Polkadot's canary network, setting the stage for parachain functionality and experiencing notable market developments.

## Technical Developments

The Kusama development team focused intensely on preparing the network for parachain functionality throughout January. Engineers worked on finalizing the auction mechanism that would later be used to allocate parachain slots on the network [1]. These preparations were critical as Kusama would serve as the testing ground before similar features would be implemented on Polkadot.

On January 13, 2021, Kusama successfully upgraded to runtime version 2027, which included various improvements to the underlying infrastructure [2]. This upgrade enhanced the network's stability and laid additional groundwork for the upcoming parachain functionality.
