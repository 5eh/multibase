# Kusama News - November 2019

# Kusama Propels Blockchain Innovation Through Unprecedented Groundbreak
## Polkadot's "Canary Network‚Äù Launch Leaps Forward 

In November 2019, a momentous change swept through the blockchain community with the official launch of the Kusama network. As Polkadot's "canary network", Kusama signifies a massive shift in blockchain testing and development, having presented a platform for projects to undertake rapid iteration prior to deployment on Polkadot's primary network.

## OpenGov Implementation: Governance Takes on New Hue 

The birthchild of Ethereum co-creator Dr. Gavin Wood, Kusama moved from its clandestine state in August 2019 to a full launch in November which oversaw the network transitioning from a centralized proof-of-authority model to a decentralized proof-of-stake paradigm. This move, according to Dr. Wood, marked "a critical step towards realizing our vision of a scalable, interoperable blockchain ecosystem". Key functionalities like staking, governance and a claims process for KSM tokens were activated, thus ensuring network stability in its formative days.

## Parachain Auctions: Unlocking the Power of Blockchain

While fully-fledged parachain functionality wasn't live in November 2019, the Kusama team paved way for the vision of future parachain auctions. Described as a groundbreaking change in blockchain resource allocation, Dr. Wood contends that "parachain auctions will create a dynamic, market-driven ecosystem where only the most innovative and well-supported projects can secure a place on the network".

## Technological Developments: Upgrades Usher Groundbreaking Changes

Several key upgrades were successfully rolled out during the month, including improvements to the network's consensus mechanism and enhanced cross-chain messaging capabilities. This not only laid the groundwork for future parachain deployments, but also strengthened the multi-chain architecture.

## Market Performance: KSM Token Makes Its Mark

Met with enthusiasm in the cryptocurrency market, KSM, which started trading on select exchanges in November 2019, saw substantial price volatility - setting itself up as a top 100 cryptocurrency by market capitalization by the end of the month.

## Developer Ecosystem: Kusama Attracts Dynamic Projects

Several high-profile projects announced their intentions to launch on Kusama, including Acala- a decentralized finance protocol aiming to bring lending services and stablecoins to the Kusama ecosystem. Co-founder Bette Chen appreciates Kusama for providing "the perfect environment to stress-test our systems and engage with a vibrant, tech-savvy community."

## Looking Forward: Stepping on The Gas for Innovation

With an aggressive roadmap laid out for the upcoming months with milestones including full parachain functionality activation, commencement of parachain auctions, and refined governance and staking mechanisms, Kusama is set to accelerate innovation, push boundaries and become a driving force behind decentralization and interoperability in blockchain technology.
