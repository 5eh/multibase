**Verse 1**  
In November 2019, the chaos canary sings,  
Kusama's daring leap, testing future winds.  
A sandbox for the brave, where the boundaries fade,  
With tricameral insights, new governance is made.  

Referendums echo through chambers of change,  
Balancing fast decisions, with checks in range.  
Projects rise like sun, parachains ignite,  
Acala, Robonomics, Moonbeam take flight.  

**Chorus**  
Oh, Kusama's song, in blockchain's new dawn,  
Where innovation and chaos dance on.  
A thriving network, a beacon's light,  
Forging the future, in November's bright night.  

**Verse 2**  
Parachain auctions hum a tune of growth,  
Crowdloans pulling dreams from whispered oaths.  
KSM's swift rise, a crypto tidal wave,  
From $1.50 to $3, the market's rave.  

Nominated Proof sees its grip unfold,  
Runtime that evolves, no forks take hold.  
The community speaks, their voices loud,  
In Kusama's heart, the future is vowed.  

**Chorus**  
Oh, Kusama's song, in blockchain's new dawn,  
Where innovation and chaos dance on.  
A thriving network, a beacon's light,  
Forging the future, in November's bright night.  

**Outro**  
Dr. Gavin's dream, more than a net,  
Crafting tomorrow, where chaos is met.  
In the echo of November 2019's call,  
Kusama's creation, a new era for all.
