**Verse 1**\
April 2021, we watched the dawn,\
Kusama's wings spread wide and strong,\
Canary in the coal mine, testing ground,\
Parachains rising, where dreams are found.

OpenGov calls, chaos in the air,\
Virtual gathering, we all share.\
Governance morphs, a community reborn,\
Workshops and whispers, a brave new form.

**Chorus**\
Kusama, lead us to the edge,\
Innovate, defy, we pledge.\
Price climbs high, take the stage,\
Blockchain dreams, turn the page.

**Verse 2**\
Parachain auctions, the future's forge,\
Moonriver and Karura, communities charge.\
XCMP crossing, seamless talks,\
Interconnected blockchains, Kusama walks.

Tokens soar, KSM in flight,\
April's promise shining bright.\
From Statemine's spark to a DAO's green plan,\
Kusama's heartbeat, where dreams began.

**Chorus**\
Kusama, lead us to the edge,\
Innovate, defy, we pledge.\
Price climbs high, take the stage,\
Blockchain dreams, turn the page.

**Bridge**\
April's end, the auctions loom,\
A new era whispers in the room.\
Scalable networks, dreams align,\
In Kusama's rhythm, the future shines.

**Chorus**\
Kusama, lead us to the edge,\
Innovate, defy, we pledge.\
Price climbs high, take the stage,\
Blockchain dreams, turn the page.
