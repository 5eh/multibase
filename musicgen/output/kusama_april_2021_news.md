# Kusama News - April 2021

# Headline: Kusama Soars on Blockchain Innovations: An April Recap

Kusama, Polkadot's experimental "canary network," showcased diverse ecosystem development and dramatic price appreciation in April 2021. As an edgier counterpart, Kusama's trial maneuvers continued to set the stage for Polkadot's operations, especially with the eagerly anticipated parachain functionality and imminent auctions.

## OpenGov Implementation: Kusama's Governance Morphs

April saw Kusama's governance mechanisms further mature, with the proposal of organization for the first-ever Kusama Conference, "CHAOS 2021." The proposed two-day virtual event aimed to unify the community and enlighten participants about the flourishing Kusama ecosystem. Planned for the conference were workshops, presentations, and networking opportunities to further integrate the Kusaman network community members.

## Kusama Parachain Auctions: Blockchain Growth Steams Ahead

As anticipation mounts for the onset of Kusama's parachain slot auctions, the preparations in April advanced considerably. Moves towards enabling the auctions came with tests to verify stability and performance on the network. The evolving parachain functionality forms the backbone for a scalable, interconnected network of specialized blockchains.

Candidates for Kusama parachains rallied their communities, with some launching crowdloan campaigns. Notable cases encompassed Karura, an Acala Network deployment, and Moonriver, paralleling Moonbeam.

## Technical Development Milestones on Kusama

The tech machinery of Kusama operated at full tilt in April. Kusama augmented its nominated proof-of-stake (NPoS) consensus mechanism while testing key features intended for future deployment on Polkadot. A central focus lay in ironing out cross-chain message passing (XCMP) for seamless and efficient blockchain exchange.

## KSM Token Market Performance: Upward Trajectory

The KSM token, Kusama's native asset, experienced a price leap in April, almost doubling from $300 to an all-time high of $623.75 on May 18th. The auction excitement and ecosystem expansion drove investor interest and trading volumes for KSM, spurring the price surge across major exchanges.

## Developer Ecosystem: Kusama's Thriving Landscape

Several projects launched or announced significant updates on Kusama, marking a buoyant expansion of the network's ecosystem. A prime instance, Statemine became the inaugural functional Kusama parachain processing permissionless transactions following an on-chain upgrade. Environmental-focused DAO IPCI project declared plans to introduce services for compensating carbon footprints and issuing digital passports for environmental products on Kusama in Q2 2021.

## Looking Forward: Parachain Auctions Loom

As April concluded, the parachain slot auctions marked the hot topics within the community. These auctions, signaling the dawn of a new era for scalable, interoperable networks, symbolize a landmark in Kusama's evolution. Kusama's dynamic progress in conjunction with experimental features adoption sets it as an innovative digital asset to watch in the forthcoming months.
