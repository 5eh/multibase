**Verse 1**\
In February '22, where the future unfolds,\
Kusama's parachains took flight, stories untold.\
A digital playground, where creators dream,\
Interchain wonders, pushing the extreme.\
Validators debated, rewards on the line,\
Community-led voices, our governance shines.

**Chorus**\
Kusama takes flight, in the blockchain sky,\
Innovations soar, as the auctions fly by.\
With every heartbeat, a network so vast,\
February '22, the future's forecast.

**Verse 2**\
NFTs and DeFi, like sparks in the dark,\
Karura and RMRK, igniting the spark.\
Cross-parachain whispers, messages flow,\
In this canary network, the seeds of hope grow.\
KSM rides the waves, steady and bold,\
Amidst the market's storm, our story is told.

**Chorus**\
Kusama takes flight, in the blockchain sky,\
Innovations soar, as the auctions fly by.\
With every heartbeat, a network so vast,\
February '22, the future's forecast.
