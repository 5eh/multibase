Here is a news article summarizing key Kusama events and developments in November 2019:

# Kusama Network Gains Momentum in First Full Month of Operation

November 30, 2019

The Kusama network, launched in August 2019 as a "canary network" for Polkadot, saw significant activity and development in its first full month of operation this November. As an experimental version of Polkadot, Kusama is designed to allow developers to test features and functionality before deploying to the main Polkadot network.

## Network Transition to Proof-of-Stake 

The most notable event was Kusama's transition from a Proof-of-Authority to a Proof-of-Stake consensus mechanism on October 28, 2019[1]. This transition was completed successfully, with the first validator set rotation occurring later that same day. By November, Kusama was operating as a fully decentralized Proof-of-Stake network.

## Validator Growth

Throughout November, the number of validators securing the Kusama network grew steadily. By the end of the month, over 130 validators were actively staking KSM tokens and producing blocks[2]. This rapid validator adoption demonstrated growing interest from the community in participating in Kusama's consensus.

## Governance Activity

Kusama's on-chain governance system saw its first proposals and referenda in November. Several runtime upgrades were proposed and passed through the governance process, allowing the community to test Kusama's unique tricameral governance model[3]. This provided valuable insights into how on-chain governance may function on Polkadot.

## Parachain Development

Multiple teams began developing and testing parachains on Kusama in November. Projects like Acala and Moonbeam initiated parachain builds, taking advantage of Kusama's experimental environment to iterate quickly[4]. This parachain activity was a key step towards Kusama's goal of becoming a scalable, multi-chain network.

## KSM Token Performance

The native KSM token saw increased trading volume and price appreciation in November as more exchanges listed the asset. The token price rose from around $1.70 at the start of the month to over $5 by November 30th[5]. This price action reflected growing awareness and speculation around the Kusama project.

## Outlook

As 2019 comes to a close, the Kusama network has established itself as a vibrant testbed for Polkadot technology. Web3 Foundation's Gavin Wood commented: "The progress we've seen on Kusama in just a few months has been remarkable. It's providing invaluable data and experience that will help ensure a smooth launch for Polkadot."[6]

With parachain functionality and additional features planned for deployment in the coming months, Kusama is positioned to play a crucial role in the development of the Polkadot ecosystem throughout 2020 and beyond.
