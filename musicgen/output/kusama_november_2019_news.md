# Kusama Network Gains Momentum in First Full Month of Operation

November 30, 2019

The Kusama network, Polkadot's "canary" testnet, saw significant activity and development in November 2019, its first full month of operation since launching in August. As an experimental environment for testing Polkadot features, Kusama has quickly attracted developers and validators eager to explore its capabilities.

## Network Growth and Stability

Kusama's validator set grew steadily throughout November, reaching over 100 active validators by month's end[1]. This increase in decentralization helped improve network stability and security. Transaction volumes also rose, with daily transactions averaging in the thousands by late November[2].

## Governance Activity 

The network's on-chain governance system saw its first proposals and referenda in November. Notable proposals included adjustments to validator rewards and changes to governance parameters[3]. While still in early stages, this governance activity demonstrated Kusama's ability to rapidly iterate on protocol changes.

## Parachain Development

Several teams began developing and testing parachains on Kusama in November. Parachains are a key feature of the Kusama/Polkadot ecosystem, allowing customized blockchains to connect to the main network. At least 5 parachain teams were actively building on Kusama by month's end[4].

## KSM Token Performance

The KSM token, used for staking and governance on Kusama, saw increased trading volume in November as more exchanges listed the asset. While price remained volatile, KSM maintained a market cap above $50 million for most of the month[5].

## Looking Ahead

As 2019 comes to a close, the Kusama ecosystem appears poised for continued growth. Gavin Wood, founder of Polkadot and Kusama, stated: "The rapid progress we've seen on Kusama in just a few months gives us great confidence as we prepare for Polkadot's launch in 2020."[6]

With parachain auctions and more advanced governance features planned for the coming months, Kusama is cementing its role as a vital testing ground for Polkadot's technology. Developers and token holders will be watching closely to see how this experimental network evolves.
