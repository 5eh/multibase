**Verse 1**\
In June 2020's light,\
Kusama broke the night,\
A daring canary flight,\
Blockchain dreams ignite.\
Proof-of-Stake sings loud and clear,\
Parachains drawing near,\
Innovations pierce the skies,\
Web3's future in our eyes.

**Chorus**\
Oh, Kusama, rise and shine,\
In the crypto world, you're a sign.\
A playground for the bold and brave,\
June's a chapter that you paved.\
With KSM soaring high,\
Feel the pulse, the market's cry.

**Verse 2**\
Parachain auctions start the race,\
Building blocks in cyberspace.\
Tokens locked, projects ready,\
Kusama’s journey, strong and steady.\
Hackusama calls to all,\
To shape the next digital sprawl.\
Treasury grants, innovation streams,\
Forging futures, coding dreams.

**Chorus**\
Oh, Kusama, rise and shine,\
In the crypto world, you’re a sign.\
A playground for the bold and brave,\
June’s a chapter that you paved.\
With KSM soaring high,\
Feel the pulse, the market’s cry.

**Outro**\
Kusama, in June's embrace,\
Pioneering the blockchain race.\
Decentralized hopes unbind,\
In your network, dreams aligned.
