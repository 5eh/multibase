**Title: Revolution in July**

_Verse 1_\
In the heart of July '24,\
Kusama rises, breaking down the door.\
ShibHub dreams and Treats align,\
Decentralized, crossing time.\
Parachains fly, seamless and bright,\
In the canary's brave new flight.

_Chorus_\
Revolution sparks in July,\
Kusama soars, reaching the sky.\
Community hands now steer the wheel,\
In this world, blockchain is real.\
Innovations lead the way,\
In the heart of July, today.

_Verse 2_\
Shib Torch burns with fiery grace,\
Tokens vanish, space to embrace.\
KSM holds through the storm,\
In a market’s chaotic form.\
Partnerships grow, real-world’s call,\
Shiba tickets rise and stand tall.

_Chorus_\
Revolution sparks in July,\
Kusama soars, reaching the sky.\
Community hands now steer the wheel,\
In this world, blockchain is real.\
Innovations lead the way,\
In the heart of July, today.

_Bridge_\
Every block, every chain,\
Building futures, breaking the chains.\
Polkadot's realm sees the light,\
Kusama strides into the night.

_Chorus_\
Revolution sparks in July,\
Kusama soars, reaching the sky.\
Community hands now steer the wheel,\
In this world, blockchain is real.\
Innovations lead the way,\
In the heart of July, today.
