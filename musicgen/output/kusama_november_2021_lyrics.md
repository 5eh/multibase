**Verse 1**  
In November '21, the chain began to sway,  
Kusama's vibrant realm lit up the blockchain way.  
OpenGov rising, the crowd's voice heard,  
Democracy in code, shaping every word.  

Parachains in auction, wild and free,  
Twelve new paths forged by community.  
Picasso painted dreams in the sky,  
115,071 KSM reaching high.  

**Chorus**  
Kusama, you're the beacon in the digital night,  
Guiding Polkadot with your fearless flight.  
As the canary sings, we find our place,  
In this brave new world, this blockchain space.  

**Verse 2**  
Technical leaps, asynchronous strides,  
Block space expanding, where innovation abides.  
The rhythm of the tokens in the market's dance,  
$509.62, a future's glance.  

A network of dreams, a testbed bold,  
In the whispers of code, a story told.  
Projects 'round the corner, eager to find,  
In Kusama's embrace, the future's aligned.  

**Chorus**  
Kusama, you're the beacon in the digital night,  
Guiding Polkadot with your fearless flight.  
As the canary sings, we find our place,  
In this brave new world, this blockchain space.  

**Outro**  
November's glow, lighting up the dawn,  
In Kusama's shadow, the future is drawn.  
The echoes of progress, our hearts entwined,  
In the blockchain's pulse, our dreams redefined.
