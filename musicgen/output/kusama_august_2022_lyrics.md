**Verse 1**\
In the dawn of August '22,\
Kusama took its flight anew,\
With parachains and visions bold,\
A proving ground where dreams unfold.

Blockchain whispers in the air,\
Tech upgrades, innovation fair,\
Asynchronous backing, swift and grand,\
Scaling heights, this canary lands.

**Chorus**\
Kusama flies, on wings of change,\
Through blockchain skies, it rearranges.\
A beacon bright, forging new ways,\
In August's light, it leads the brave.

**Verse 2**\
Augmenting strength in vibrant veins,\
Parachain auctions spark the flame.\
Kintsugi BTC embraced the call,\
While Parallel Heiko stands tall.

DeFi dances, Moonriver shines,\
Active addresses climbing high.\
Karura's chorus, yield farms sing,\
In Kusama's field, new life springs.

**Chorus**\
Kusama flies, on wings of change,\
Through blockchain skies, it rearranges.\
A beacon bright, forging new ways,\
In August's light, it leads the brave.

**Bridge**\
OpenGov guides the hopeful throng,\
Gavin's vision, ever strong.\
Council votes and market tides,\
KSM rallies, where progress rides.

**Chorus**\
Kusama flies, on wings of change,\
Through blockchain skies, it rearranges.\
A beacon bright, forging new ways,\
In August's light, it leads the brave.

**Outro**\
In the heart of blockchain lore,\
Kusama soars forevermore.\
August '22, a chapter bold,\
In this tale of gold, the future's told.
