**Verse 1:**  
In April 2020, under skies of change,  
Kusama rose, in blockchain's endless range.  
Uncertain world, but we stood strong,  
A network of dreams, where we belong.  

Governance shifted, new pathways to find,  
Treasures of talent, in a decentralized mind.  
Validator dreams, securing the night,  
In the heart of the code, futures ignite.  

**Chorus:**  
Oh, Kusama, blazing bright,  
A beacon in the cryptic night.  
With every block, we dare to dream,  
A world reborn in digital streams.  

**Verse 2:**  
Parachains blossomed, new projects in bloom,  
Uniarts sang, breaking art's old gloom.  
Plasm's whispers, scaling the heights,  
April saw futures in Kusama's lights.  

Waves of code, Substrateâ€™s beat,  
Cross-chain messages, dreams to meet.  
KSM soared, resilient and bold,  
In turbulent seas, stories unfold.  

**Chorus:**  
Oh, Kusama, blazing bright,  
A beacon in the cryptic night.  
With every block, we dare to dream,  
A world reborn in digital streams.  

**Outro:**  
Together we forge, in April's embrace,  
Kusama, our map in this boundless space.
