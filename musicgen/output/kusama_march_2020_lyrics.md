**Verse 1:**

In March 2020’s storm, a new dawn breaks,  
Kusama flies, while the market quakes.  
A canary call in the crypto night,  
Holding strong, taking flight.  

OpenGov's heart, where voices unite,  
Democracy dancing in blockchain light.  
Chaos swirls but trust prevails,  
A network's resilience never fails.  

**Chorus:**

Kusama, rise above the tide,  
Parachains align, side by side.  
Through the storm, we light the way,  
In March 2020, a brighter day.  

**Verse 2:**

KSM stands as a beacon bold,  
In a market storm, its story told.  
With every drop, a promise made,  
Investor trust that won't fade.  

Developers dream and hackathons play,  
Grants are given, paving the way.  
A vibrant spirit, unyielding force,  
Kusama’s on its destined course.  

**Chorus:**

Kusama, rise above the tide,  
Parachains align, side by side.  
Through the storm, we light the way,  
In March 2020, a brighter day.  

**Bridge:**

Governance in motion, a symphony true,  
Innovative steps with every move.  
The power of many, a single voice,  
In challenging times, we rejoice.  

**Chorus:**

Kusama, rise above the tide,  
Parachains align, side by side.  
Through the storm, we light the way,  
In March 2020, a brighter day.  

**Outro:**

Kusama flies where the future's sown,   
In blockchain's light, our strength is known.  
March 2020, a journey begun,  
Guiding Polkadot, our work’s not done.
