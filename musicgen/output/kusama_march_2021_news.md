# Kusama March Makeover: Surging Token, Auction Preparations, and Ecosystem Developments

In a month pulsing with promises and delivery, the Kusama network, Polkadot's canary network, marked March 2021 with outstanding developments in multiple fronts, leveraging its unique technology for network-wide growth and evolution.

## OpenGov Metamorphosis Amplifies Kusama's Vigour

A new chapter in the Kusama story evolved this past March, catalyzed by significant governance changes. The proposals up for discussion addressed some considerable adjustments to the Kusama’s validator landscape.

One ground-breaking proposal argued for expanding the present 900 validators on the network to 1000. A suggestion clearly anticipating the fast-paced growth of Kusama, designed to bolster decentralization and solidity of the network.

Kusama community, stakeholders actively engaged in luminary debates to finalize the structure for the upcoming parachain auctions deliberated upon auction durations and slot distributions.

## Parachain Auctions Turning Heads

Attention steered towards Kusama network with the swiftly advancing preparations for the long-awaited parachain slot auctions, a conduit for projects aiming to secure a spot to build on this ever-evolving network. 

Gavin Wood, the genius behind Polkadot and Kusama, teased the possibility of parachain auctions launching by April or May, contingent upon audits and governance approval. The clarion was taken up with intensity by Acala Network's Karura, Moonbeam's Moonriver, and Plasm Network, who declared their bid for a slot and strategized their initiatives for crowdloans.

## Innovation Triumphs with Technical Triumphs 

Keeping the momentum high were the upgrades achieved this March. The successful launch of runtime upgrade v0.8.29, equipped with critical improvements supporting the parachain functionality, manifested Kusama's agility in adopting updates through its on-chain governance.

Further cementing the anticipation of parachain launch, the Kusama community greenlighted the Shell parachain, planned to assess cross-chain messaging and verify the stability of the relay chain.

## Bumper-Period for KSM Market Performance

March set record-highs for Kusama's native token, KSM, with prices soaring over 140% within the month. Beginning with a modest value of around $225, KSM touched an all-time high of $547.91 on March 29. The trading volume for KSM also showed a significant upturn, with a daily average often exceeding $400 million. Analysts attributed this dramatic escalation to speculation around the upcoming parachain auctions and the heightened perception of Kusama's potential in the Polkadot ecosystem.

## Developer Ecosystem Thrives Amid Standing-Out Projects

Kusama's rapid expansion and lower entry barriers compared to Polkadot continued to attract projects, leading to significant ecosystem growth in March. The identity project, KILT Protocol, announced plans to use the Kusama network as their development playground. Unique Network and the NFT project, RMRK also joined Kusama, planning to create unique NFT experiences utilizing its fast finality and low transaction costs.

## Vision Forward: Kusama's March to Bookmark 

Given the audacious advances in March, Kusama’s future holds the promise of monumental strides. The culmination of the eager anticipation will be the official commencement of the parachain slot auctions, followed by the deployment of the first fully functional parachains on Kusama and the introduction of cross-chain messaging and interoperability feature. 

And as the Kusama ecosystem expands with the influx of more projects, Kusama’s foresight of its canary network as an innovation engine-and-testing ground places it in a commanding position as a significant contributor to the decentralized future.
