**Verse 1**  
August 2021, where the stars align,  
Kusama grows bold, crossing the line.  
Parachains rise, a community's dream,  
Kusama’s heart, a fiery stream.  

New governance leads, stakes hold the sky,  
Caps and limits, keep tensions high.  
In this dance of tech and trust,  
Kusama's spirit, in code, we trust.  

**Chorus**  
Riding high, through the digital night,  
Kusama soars, wings of light.  
In the blockchain's endless game,  
We write our future, in Kusama’s name.  

**Verse 2**  
Moonriver shines, Shiden's call,  
On Kusama's stage, we give it all.  
Real-world dreams in NFTs,  
Statemine's magic, sets assets free.  

Tokens fly, KSM’s climb,  
Numbers tell a tale of time.  
With auctions igniting, new paths unfold,  
Kusama's journey, a story bold.  

**Chorus**  
Riding high, through the digital night,  
Kusama soars, wings of light.  
In the blockchain's endless game,  
We write our future, in Kusama’s name.  

**Outro**  
In September’s dawn, dreams ignite,  
Kusama leads, into the light.
