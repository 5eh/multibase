**Verse 1**  
In the winds of March '23,  
Kusama stands tall, wild and free,  
Casting off the chains of old,  
OpenGov's new tales unfold.  
Community voices, loud and clear,  
Guiding us, innovation near.  
Parachains rising, claiming the skies,  
Krest and others reaching high.

**Chorus**  
On the frontier of change, we reign,  
Kusama's spirit won't be tamed.  
Through chaos and calm, we glide,  
In March '23, we ride.  
Bound by dreams, the future's bright,  
In blockchain's heart, we ignite.

**Verse 2**  
Asynchronous dreams take flight,  
In the heart of the night.  
Privacy's shield, zero-knowledge dreams,  
Forging paths in data streams.  
KSM stands through market storm,  
Silent strength, a norm reborn.  
With every code, with every line,  
Kusama's legacy will shine.

**Chorus**  
On the frontier of change, we reign,  
Kusama's spirit won't be tamed.  
Through chaos and calm, we glide,  
In March '23, we ride.  
Bound by dreams, the future's bright,  
In blockchain's heart, we ignite.
