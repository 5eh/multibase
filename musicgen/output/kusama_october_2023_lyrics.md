**Verse 1**\
October 2023, echoes in the blockchain air,\
Kusama, the canary, rising with a daring flair.\
OpenGov breaks, democracies take flight,\
Gavin's words ring true, in this new era's light.

**Chorus**\
Oh Kusama, you’re a force, no longer under shadow,\
With wings of change, the blockchain’s new bravado.\
Canary sings its song, in a digital sky so wide,\
Oh Kusama, lead the tide, where innovation rides.

**Verse 2**\
Parachains rejoice, as auctions light the flame,\
Kintsugi and Karura, adding power to the name.\
Dancing in the market, a KSM surge so bold,\
In this enlivened realm, new narratives unfold.

**Chorus**\
Oh Kusama, you’re a force, no longer under shadow,\
With wings of change, the blockchain’s new bravado.\
Canary sings its song, in a digital sky so wide,\
Oh Kusama, lead the tide, where innovation rides.

**Bridge**\
Asynchronous dreams, with speeds to enthrall,\
Kusama's vision, watching barriers fall.\
Developer hearts ignite, in this spirited domain,\
And the world takes note, of Kusama's reign.

**Outro**\
Oh Kusama, beacon bright, in a world of endless quest,\
October 2023, your legacy manifests.\
Not just a sibling, but a leader unconfined,\
Oh Kusama, forge ahead, in the blockchain’s mind.
