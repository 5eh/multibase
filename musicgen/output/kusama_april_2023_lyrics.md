**Verse 1**\
In April 2023, we saw the rise,\
Kusama's canary taking flight,\
Zero-Knowledge dreams now realized,\
With OpenGov, it ignites.\
Chaotic calls for privacy,\
A manifesto bold and free,\
Chains of change in auction's race,\
Where Turing Network finds its place.

**Chorus**\
Kusama, daring to dream,\
In a world of chains and streams,\
Experimental, wild, and true,\
April’s echoes calling you.\
Innovations weave the light,\
Decentralized and reaching heights,\
Kusama, heart of the unknown,\
In April 2023, seeds were sown.

**Verse 2**\
Composables crossing boundaries,\
Centauri bridges, bold and clear,\
Polkadot to Kusama’s seas,\
Crypto flows through seamless spheres.\
KSM stands strong through market's storm,\
Resilient in its fierce form,\
Moonriver’s glow, Karura’s rise,\
In developer dreams, it flies.

**Chorus**\
Kusama, daring to dream,\
In a world of chains and streams,\
Experimental, wild, and true,\
April’s echoes calling you.\
Innovations weave the light,\
Decentralized and reaching heights,\
Kusama, heart of the unknown,\
In April 2023, seeds were sown.
