# Kusama Skyrockets as Polkadot's "Wild Cousin" Attracts Developers

The "canary network" for Polkadot, Kusama, showed stripes of significant development and growth in November 2020, aligning itself as a real-world testing ground for blockchain projects ahead of a Polkadot deployment. 

## OpenGov Implementation: Kusama's Governance Shifts

Kusama's governance model witnessed a surge of activity with a proposal to raise validator count from 900 to 1000 gaining extensive approval. Kusama's technical front ushered in XCMP (Cross-Chain Message Passing), a key upgrade enhancing network performance and scalability, leading to improved intercommunication between its blockchain "shards”. "The rapid experimentation on Kusama is indeed what we envisaged and will undoubtedly reverberate across the Polkadot ecosystem," stated Gavin Wood, Polkadot and Kusama's founder.

## Parachain Auctions Fuel Kusama's Blockchain Growth

In anticipation for Kusama’s impending parachain slot auctions, several acclaimed projects have announced plans to bid for these slots. The fervor surrounding these auctions has radiated interest towards the Kusama ecosystem, with projects such as Composable Finance announcing their plans for their Picasso parachain on Kusama to test their DeFi protocols prior to a possible Polkadot launch.

## Technical Developments Sail Kusama Forward

Kusama, running the gauntlet of technical upgrades, made massive strides towards full interoperability. Key developments included the activation of Cross-Chain Message Passing (XCMP), marking a significant milestone for blockchain intercommunication improvements in the Kusama ecosystem.

## KSM Token Thrives in Market Activity

Accelerating interest brought a positive price increase for Kusama's native KSM token. From starting November at around $26, KSM closed at an impressive $45, a gain of more than 70%. Increased liquidity and market interest reflected the growing confidence in Kusama's potential.

## Developer Ecosystem: New Blood Infuses Kusama

Kusama welcomed several innovative projects in November, underscoring its potential to host cutting-edge applications. Subsocial, a decentralized social network, and Kilt Protocol, aiming to bring decentralized identity solutions, built traction on Kusama. It also attracted interest from Ethereum projects, showcasing its potential to bridge different blockchain ecosystems.

## Looking Forward: What's Next for Kusama?

Kusama's community eagerly awaits the launch of parachain auctions and improvements to its core infrastructure. As Polkadot’s canary network, Kusama's role in pushing the boundaries of blockchain technology into 2021 cannot be overstated. As it develops, Kusama becomes more than a testing site; it emerges as a nascent blockchain ecosystem in its own right.
