**Verse 1:** In the heart of July, twenty-twenty's sky,\
Kusama soared, a canary's cry,\
Building paths for blockchain dreams,\
With parachains in streaming beams.

Community voices, loud and clear,\
Governance held by KSM's sphere,\
Referenda shaping the way,\
Decentralized future, here to stay.

**Chorus:**\
Oh, in July 2020, the dawn of a new day,\
Kusama's promise, never fades away,\
A testbed for the brave and bold,\
In this blockchain story, dreams unfold.

**Verse 2:**\
Security flows through nine hundred strong,\
Validators in harmony's song,\
The groundwork laid for auctions wide,\
In Kusama's realm, where visions bide.

For developers seeking a fertile ground,\
In Kusama's light, hope is found,\
New teams rise with dreams on fire,\
Polkadot's shadow, their desire.

**Chorus:**\
Oh, in July 2020, the dawn of a new day,\
Kusama's promise, never fades away,\
A testbed for the brave and bold,\
In this blockchain story, dreams unfold.

**Outro:**\
A spark in the market's wild embrace,\
KSM leads the pioneering race,\
The future of tech, a canvas wide,\
Kusama's journey, a fearless stride.
