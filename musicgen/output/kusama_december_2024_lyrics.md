**Chorus:** Kusama rising, breaking every chain,\
In December ‘24, it’s making its name.\
OpenGov sparks the egalitarian dream,\
In the crypto skies, Kusama’s gleam.

**Verse 1:** Transaction speeds that light up the night,\
Parachains dancing in the vibrant light.\
A playground of dreams, a technicolor track,\
With bridges built, there’s no turning back.

Hierarchies fall, decision hands extend,\
The OpenGov wave, where all voices blend.\
KSM soaring, with stars in its eyes,\
Boundless potential in these blockchain skies.

**Chorus:** Kusama rising, breaking every chain,\
In December ‘24, it’s making its name.\
OpenGov sparks the egalitarian dream,\
In the crypto skies, Kusama’s gleam.

**Verse 2:** Developers gather, crafting futures untold,\
A Canvas for creation, fearless and bold.\
Scalability and vision, in harmony they play,\
Pioneering the paths where tomorrow lays.

In finance and gaming, the boundaries they nudge,\
Innovation is echoing with every judge.\
Cross-network echoes, technology's embrace,\
Kusama's spirit, a limitless space.

**Chorus:** Kusama rising, breaking every chain,\
In December ‘24, it’s making its name.\
OpenGov sparks the egalitarian dream,\
In the crypto skies, Kusama’s gleam.

**Outro:** The promise of tomorrow is writing its lore,\
Kusama, a beacon, forevermore.
