**Verse 1**\
In October 2024, a canary in flight,\
Kusama's wings stretch wide, soaring into the light.\
Governance evolves, 1,500 strong,\
Transparent and bold, where we all belong.\
Heated debates on DeFi and NFTs,\
A network alive, with new possibilities.

**Chorus**\
Kusama's heartbeat, innovation's call,\
A beacon of change, built by us all.\
With a spirit unyielding, and a vision so bright,\
The early bird's song, echoes through the night.

**Verse 2**\
Parachains auction slots, dreams take their stand,\
Turing Network rises, a future unplanned.\
Asynchronous backing, version 2.0,\
Scalability leaps, as transactions flow.\
KSM soars high on market waves,\
A token of progress, no one could enslave.

**Chorus**\
Kusama's heartbeat, innovation's call,\
A beacon of change, built by us all.\
With a spirit unyielding, and a vision so bright,\
The early bird's song, echoes through the night.

**Outro**\
Towards 2025, we set our course true,\
Scalability, growth, in a vibrant hue.\
Kusama leads on, with courage and might,\
The early bird's song, still soaring high.\
In October 2024, our future took flight.
