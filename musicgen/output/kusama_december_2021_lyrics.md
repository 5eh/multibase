**Chorus:**  
In December '21, a network soared,  
Parachains won, new dreams restored.  
Kusama's call, brave hearts align,  
Building bridges in blockchain's time.

**Verse 1:**  
Eleventh auction, a crown was won,  
Kintsugi rose, dreams weighed a ton.  
Two hundred thousand KSM in hand,  
A future forged in digital sand.  
Volatile waves, markets rise and fall,  
Yet Kusama stands, resilient through it all.  
Transaction speeds, messages cross,  
Communities grow, no dreams are lost.

**Chorus:**  
In December '21, a network soared,  
Parachains won, new dreams restored.  
Kusama's call, brave hearts align,  
Building bridges in blockchain's time.

**Verse 2:**  
Developer dreams, visions unfold,  
Subsocial's net, new stories told.  
With cross-chain words and governance renewed,  
A network thrives, under promises imbued.  
Technical paths and ecosystems bloom,  
Parachain roots begin to consume.  
Inclusion's voice, calls for all,  
Kusamaâ€™s world, where pioneers rally tall.

**Chorus:**  
In December '21, a network soared,  
Parachains won, new dreams restored.  
Kusama's call, brave hearts align,  
Building bridges in blockchain's time.  

**Outro:**  
Promises of hope, a future bright,  
Kusama's journey, into the light.  
In Polkadot's shadow, it paves the way,  
A path for progress, where innovation stays.
