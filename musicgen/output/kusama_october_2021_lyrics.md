**(Chorus)**  
Under the October sky, 2021,  
Kusama's race has just begun.  
Governance strong, OpenGov reigns,  
In this chain of freedom, unbroken chains.

**(Verse 1)**  
Parachains bloom in the auction's light,  
Twelve keys unlocked, setting futures bright.  
From crowdloans rise community voices,  
49,000 strong, making bold choices.  
Kintsugi wins in this grand dance,  
$3.88 million, a chance to advance.  
With every block, new tech takes flight,  
Stable and ready, defying the night.

**(Chorus)**  
Under the October sky, 2021,  
Kusama's race has just begun.  
Governance strong, OpenGov reigns,  
In this chain of freedom, unbroken chains.

**(Verse 2)**  
KSM swirls in the market's tide,  
Price falls low, yet dreams don't hide.  
Developers' hearts set the pace,  
Unique visions, NFTs in space.  
Acala and Blockdaemon build bridges wide,  
DeFi blooms, nowhere to hide.  
Lessons learned, Polkadot's guide,  
Kusama, the bellwether, standing with pride.

**(Chorus)**  
Under the October sky, 2021,  
Kusama's race has just begun.  
Governance strong, OpenGov reigns,  
In this chain of freedom, unbroken chains.

**(Outro)**  
Scalability, dreams unfold,  
Kusama's story yet to be told.  
In innovation's light, we trust,  
October 2021, leaving its mark in dust.
