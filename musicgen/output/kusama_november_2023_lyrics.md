**Verse 1**\
In November twenty twenty-three,\
Kusama soared with wings of glee,\
A canary bold, testing the night,\
Governance shifted, a vision's light.

Parachain dreams, auction's thrill,\
Bit.Country rose, the KSM spill,\
Metaverse maps in our hands,\
LAOS project crafting new lands.

**Chorus**\
Oh, Kusama, on the edge of dreams,\
Daring futures, where nothing's as it seems,\
Innovations fly on woven streams,\
November's fire, ignites our schemes.

**Verse 2**\
Asynchronous beats, a rhythm of change,\
Latency falls, throughput's range,\
Ecosystem buzzing, whispers in code,\
Testing new paths, a future to decode.

Kusama Agents, voices of tomorrow,\
Layer 0 foundations, truths we borrow,\
Market tides rise, then they fall,\
Experimental nature answers the call.

**Chorus**\
Oh, Kusama, on the edge of dreams,\
Daring futures, where nothing's as it seems,\
Innovations fly on woven streams,\
November's fire, ignites our schemes.

**Bridge**\
Zero-knowledge whispers, secrets kept,\
Privacy, scalesâ€”the promises swept,\
In November's glow, boundaries bend,\
Kusama's heart, where visions blend.

**Chorus**\
Oh, Kusama, on the edge of dreams,\
Daring futures, where nothing's as it seems,\
Innovations fly on woven streams,\
November's fire, ignites our schemes.

**Outro**\
Kusama's dance, a beacon bright,\
In Polkadot's shadow, a guiding light.\
Future's canvas, blank and wide,\
November's tale, where bold hearts stride.
