**Verse 1**\
April 2022, a dawn in the blockchain sky,\
Kusama bloomed with courage, reaching up so high.\
Governance evolved, new voices took a stand,\
Bags-list staking echoes, spreading through the land.\
Chasing dreams of fairness, strength in unity,\
Breaking through the shadows, forging destiny.

**Chorus**\
Kusama, daring heart of gold,\
In April's light, your story unfolds.\
Parachains and dreams collide,\
With bold steps, you set the tide.\
Kusama, voices loud and true,\
Crafting futures, breaking through.

**Verse 2**\
In the race for slots, projects rise and fall,\
Privacy and gaming, answering the call.\
Karura, Shiden, with bridges in their eyes,\
Robonomics lifts the veil, IoT skies.\
April's vibrant canvas, painted with resolve,\
Innovations spark the flame, watch the dawn evolve.

**Chorus**\
Kusama, daring heart of gold,\
In April's light, your story unfolds.\
Parachains and dreams collide,\
With bold steps, you set the tide.\
Kusama, voices loud and true,\
Crafting futures, breaking through.

**Bridge**\
In the face of market storms,\
KSM stands firm and warm.\
April's whispers in the night,\
Promise of a brighter sight.

**Chorus**\
Kusama, daring heart of gold,\
In April's light, your story unfolds.\
Parachains and dreams collide,\
With bold steps, you set the tide.\
Kusama, voices loud and true,\
Crafting futures, breaking through.
