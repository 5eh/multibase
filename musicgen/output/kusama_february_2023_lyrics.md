**Kusama's Revolution**

_(Verse 1)_\
February 2023, the winds of change arise,\
Kusama's path unfolds, under Polkadot skies.\
Governance forged anew, community ignites,\
Parachains connect, bridging endless heights.

Krest claimed its throne, the 72nd ride,\
A thousand voices strong, in KSM they abide.\
Blockchain dreams alight, in the canary's flight,\
Innovation's dawn, in the darkness of night.

_(Chorus)_\
Oh, Kusama, bold and free,\
Forging futures, we can see.\
Interwoven chains, harmony's decree,\
In February 2023.

_(Verse 2)_\
BEEFY bridges built, cross-chain dreams alive,\
Ethereum's embrace, where diversities thrive.\
Snowbridge, Hyperbridge, connect the great divide,\
A universe of blockchains, side by side.

Tokens rising slow, yet in sync with the beat,\
Market doubts and dreams, they compete.\
For identities reborn, SubSocial, KILT shine,\
In this fertile ground, where the future aligns.

_(Chorus)_\
Oh, Kusama, bold and free,\
Forging futures, we can see.\
Interwoven chains, harmony's decree,\
In February 2023.

_(Outro)_\
Kusama's legacy, of tech and dreams aligned,\
In the heart of change, a rhythm redefined.\
A banner in the storm, for Web3's new spree,\
Leading us forward, in eternal unity.
