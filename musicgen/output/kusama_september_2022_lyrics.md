**Verse 1:** Under the shadow of a crypto fall,\
Kusama soars with resilience, standing tall.\
Governance shifts, a new path to tread,\
Voices rise as control's widespread.\
In September '22, hope ignites,\
With dreams of decentralization's lights.

**Chorus:**\
In the silence of a bear's embrace,\
Kusama's heart beats at a steady pace.\
We never stop building, come what may,\
In September's echo, we find our way.

**Verse 2:**\
Parachains bloom like stars in the night,\
Karura, Moonriver, pushing forward with might.\
Cross-chain bridges from Acala's gate,\
Interwoven futures, sealing fate.\
Tokens in turmoil, yet spirits stay true,\
Innovations thrive in a bold debut.

**Chorus:**\
In the silence of a bear's embrace,\
Kusama's heart beats at a steady pace.\
We never stop building, come what may,\
In September's echo, we find our way.

**Outro:**\
Kusama, the canary that sings,\
Amidst the downturn, new growth springs.\
In the shadows, our dreams take flight,\
Guided by stars in the crypto night.
