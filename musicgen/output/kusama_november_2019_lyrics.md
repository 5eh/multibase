**Verse 1:**  
In the land of digital dreams, where wild ideas roam,  
Kusama rose like dawn, beneath a shimmering dome.  
A canary in the coalmine, testing skies so high,  
November 2019, under a technicolor sky.  

Proof-of-Stake was born, with promises to keep,  
Validators gathered, sowing seeds they would reap.  
A hundred thirty strong, staking KSM with pride,  
Building blocks in the chain, where ambition would ride.

**Chorus:**  
Oh, November 2019, in the heart of blockchain dreams,  
Where Kusama spread its wings, on pathways of moonbeams.  
A network gaining strength, in a symphony of code,  
Guiding us to futures, where innovation flowed.  

**Verse 2:**  
Governance by the people, on-chain voices spoke,  
Proposals turned to action, the tricameral awoke.  
Parachains in motion, Acala, Moonbeam's glide,  
A tapestry of projects, on Kusama's wild ride.  

Tokens danced in the market, from $1.70 to five,  
KSM found new heights, as the network came alive.  
Hope and speculation, in each rising tide,  
Fueling the journey, where potential would collide.

**Chorus:**  
Oh, November 2019, in the heart of blockchain dreams,  
Where Kusama spread its wings, on pathways of moonbeams.  
A network gaining strength, in a symphony of code,  
Guiding us to futures, where innovation flowed.  

**Bridge:**  
Gavin's words of wisdom, in each block and byte,  
Kusama's vivid tale, a radiant guiding light.  
Forging paths for Polkadot, in shadows and in gleams,  
A testbed for the future, built on digital dreams.

**Outro:**  
November 2019, a chapter now retold,  
In the pulse of Kusama, a story to unfold.  
Together we will journey, through the unknown and the free,  
Where the canary network sings, in a blockchain symphony.
