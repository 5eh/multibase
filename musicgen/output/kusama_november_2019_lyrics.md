**Verse 1:**\
In the wild fields of code, Kusama thrives,\
Gavin's vision in this digital hive.\
November 2019, a time of change,\
Parachains on the rise, breaking the chain.

Testing the waters, governance takes flight,\
Voting and proposals through the endless night.\
Kusama's playground, where futures ignite,\
A dance on the edge, in the blockchain light.

**Chorus:**\
In this chaotic land, where dreams take flight,\
Kusama's heartbeat pulses through the night.\
November's echoes, in the code we trust,\
Building tomorrow from the digital dust.

**Verse 2:**\
Validator rotation, a step to the new,\
Proof-of-stake journey, a path to pursue.\
KSM surges, traders are keen,\
Security and growth, a vibrant scene.

Acala and Karura, names on the breeze,\
Tethering to chains, like leaves in the trees.\
Innovations bloom, the treasury's grace,\
Funding dreams in this decentralized space.

**Chorus:**\
In this chaotic land, where dreams take flight,\
Kusama's heartbeat pulses through the night.\
November's echoes, in the code we trust,\
Building tomorrow from the digital dust.

**Bridge:**\
David's words echo, with futures we explore,\
Kusama's heartbeat, forever more.\
Cross-chain whispers, a promise untold,\
In November's light, the new world unfolds.

**Chorus:**\
In this chaotic land, where dreams take flight,\
Kusama's heartbeat pulses through the night.\
November's echoes, in the code we trust,\
Building tomorrow from the digital dust.

**Outro:**\
Kusama's wild song, a techno-brave heart,\
Guiding Polkadot with a head start.\
November 2019, a legend unfurl,\
In the blockchain fabric of our world.
