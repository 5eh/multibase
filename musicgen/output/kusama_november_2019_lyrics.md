**Verse 1**\
In the shadows, a spark ignites,\
Kusama takes flight in the dark of night.\
A canary in the coal mine, paving the way,\
Testing dreams before the light of day.\
Dr. Wood dreamed of a world so grand,\
Where chains could dance, hand in hand.\
November 2019, a moment defined,\
Proof-of-stake released, decentralized mind.

**Chorus**\
Oh, Kusama, canary bold,\
In November 2019, stories untold.\
Blazing trails in blockchain skies,\
With every heart and every rise.\
Oh, Kusama, where dreams align,\
In that month, we saw the signs.

**Verse 2**\
Governance painted in colors anew,\
Staking claims for a vision so true.\
Parachains waiting, a promise near,\
A future of auctions and innovation here.\
KSM token, a market surprise,\
Volatile like the sunrise.\
Acala whispers in the breeze,\
Lending life to DeFi dreams with ease.

**Chorus**\
Oh, Kusama, canary bold,\
In November 2019, stories untold.\
Blazing trails in blockchain skies,\
With every heart and every rise.\
Oh, Kusama, where dreams align,\
In that month, we saw the signs.

**Bridge**\
Dynamic projects come to play,\
In this world where tech holds sway.\
Cross-chain whispers, connecting all,\
Building bridges where barriers fall.

**Chorus**\
Oh, Kusama, canary bold,\
In November 2019, stories untold.\
Blazing trails in blockchain skies,\
With every heart and every rise.\
Oh, Kusama, where dreams align,\
In that month, we saw the signs.

**Outro**\
November fades but the journey stays,\
In Kusama’s realm, where future lays.\
A stage for dreams, bold and free,\
Kusama’s song, eternity.
