**Verse 1:**

In the dawn of a digital frontier,  
November 2019 carved its name,   
Kusama rose, a canary so bold,  
In this blockchain tale, her story's told.  

From proof-of-authority, a shift so wise,  
To a proof-of-stake world, where voices rise.  
The Web3 Foundation let the reins fall,  
And governance bloomed for one and all.  

**Chorus:**

Oh, Kusama, in the blockchain's embrace,  
November 2019 set the pace.  
With parachains and KSM's might,  
We venture into the endless night.  

**Verse 2:**

Parachain auctions, arenas of dreams,  
Karura and Moonriver light up the streams.  
400,000 blocks, a testament true,  
In the heart of Kusama, we see the futureâ€™s hue.  

A bustling community grows here in time,  
With councils and discourse, a rhythm and rhyme.  
Kusama's spirit in Rococo's light,  
In innovation's name, we take flight.  

**Chorus:**

Oh, Kusama, in the blockchain's embrace,  
November 2019 set the pace.  
With parachains and KSM's might,  
We venture into the endless night.  

**Bridge:**

Gavin whispers, with hope in his eyes,  
"A scalable world, beyond the skies."  
Cross-chain messaging, a promise so bright,  
In Kusama's hands, we find the light.  

**Outro:**

As 2019 fades into tomorrow's view,  
Kusama stands, bold and true.  
A canary leading the charge ahead,  
In blockchain's sea, where dreams are spread.  

**Chorus:**

Oh, Kusama, in the blockchain's embrace,  
November 2019 set the pace.  
With parachains and KSM's might,  
We venture into the endless night.
