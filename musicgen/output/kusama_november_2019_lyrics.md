**(Verse 1)**  
In the haze of November, twenty-nineteen,  
A canary took flight in a digital dream,  
Through the wires of the world, a whispering net,  
Kusama's bold journey just starting to set.  
Validators gathered, a hundred strong,  
Weaving a tapestry where they belong.  
Decentralized voices, a chorus of code,  
Building a future where dreams can unfold.  

**(Chorus)**  
Oh, November 2019, when Kusama soared,  
An experimental realm where ideas poured.  
In the heart of the blockchain, a revolution woke,  
Kusama, your spirit, in every heartbeat spoke.  

**(Verse 2)**  
Governance awoke, from slumber arose,  
Referenda and proposals, the path we chose.  
Changes in the air, like autumn leaves,  
Adjusting rewards, with belief, it breathes.  
Parachains began their first design,  
Connecting worlds in a network so fine.  
Staking the future on the wings of KSM,  
Every transaction a note in this anthem.  

**(Chorus)**  
Oh, November 2019, when Kusama soared,  
An experimental realm where ideas poured.  
In the heart of the blockchain, a revolution woke,  
Kusama, your spirit, in every heartbeat spoke.  

**(Bridge)**  
As Gavin Wood said, we move toward the dawn,  
Where Polkadot waits with the curtains drawn.  
A vital testing ground, where the brave explore,  
In this digital symphony, we are forevermore.  

**(Outro)**  
In the echoes of November, memories remain,  
A network of dreams with nothing to restrain.  
The rhythm of progress, steady and true,  
Kusama, we'll follow the journey with you.
