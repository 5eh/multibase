**(Verse 1)**\
In the storm of May '23,\
Kusama stood, wild and free,\
OpenGov brought new light,\
Decentralized, shining bright.

Picasso and Mangata rise,\
In parachain, skies, no surprise,\
Forty-two flames ignite the night,\
Kusama grows, in endless flight.

**(Chorus)**\
Resilient heart, in chaos found,\
Kusama's voice, a hopeful sound,\
Against the winds, it charts its course,\
Innovation, an unstoppable force.

**(Verse 2)**\
Tech upgrades, a future refined,\
Asynchronous backing, peace of mind,\
Consensus stronger, scales untold,\
Kusama's tale of courage bold.

KSM stands firm, storms defied,\
Harmony crafted, with pride,\
Developer dreams weave through the code,\
A vibrant path, a shining road.

**(Chorus)**\
Resilient heart, in chaos found,\
Kusama's voice, a hopeful sound,\
Against the winds, it charts its course,\
Innovation, an unstoppable force.

**(Outro)**\
Eyes set on June's dawn,\
In the blockchain's boundless song,\
Kusama leads where dreams are born,\
A canary sings, in the break of morn.
