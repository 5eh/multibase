**Chorus:**\
In January 2024, we stand,\
Kusama's revolution in our hands.\
Parachains grow, the tech evolves,\
A blockchain dream that's being solved.

**Verse 1:**\
On the wings of change, a canary sings,\
In governance halls, the future rings.\
Community voices, strong and free,\
Shaping the course so daringly.\
Treasuries aligned for growth to span,\
Bridging dreams with Kintsugi's plan.\
With zero-knowledge as our guide,\
Privacy and progress stride side by side.

**Chorus:**\
In January 2024, we stand,\
Kusama's revolution in our hands.\
Parachains grow, the tech evolves,\
A blockchain dream that's being solved.

**Verse 2:**\
High-performance maps in Dapps' domain,\
Asynchronous powers lead the chain.\
Where developers dream, new worlds arise,\
A thriving network under starry skies.\
Through storm and surge, KSM holds tight,\
Resilience in every investorâ€™s sight.\
Boundless potential, a future we weave,\
In Kusama's song, we dare to believe.

**Chorus:**\
In January 2024, we stand,\
Kusama's revolution in our hands.\
Parachains grow, the tech evolves,\
A blockchain dream that's being solved.
