**Verse 1**\
In a world of chaos and stormy days,\
Kusama rose, found its way,\
Through November, it stood tall,\
Breaking barriers, answering the call.

OpenGov's voice, a new revolution,\
Turning the tide to pure evolution.\
Asynchronous dreams, speeding fast,\
Building a future that’s meant to last.

**Chorus**\
November 2022, the time we grew,\
In a world of chains, we broke through.\
In the heart of the storm, we found our place,\
Kusama’s light in the crypto space.

**Verse 2**\
Parachain whispers in the dark,\
Enterprises bidding for their spark.\
Cross-chain bridges to new lands,\
Kusama's strength in unity stands.

KSM, resilient in the fight,\
While others faltered, you shined bright.\
Picasso painted dreams so bold,\
Identity found, a story retold.

**Chorus**\
November 2022, the time we grew,\
In a world of chains, we broke through.\
In the heart of the storm, we found our place,\
Kusama’s light in the crypto space.

**Outro**\
As we look ahead, the future's clear,\
Kusama's journey, we're all near.\
A decentralized dream we embrace,\
Building tomorrow in this digital race.
