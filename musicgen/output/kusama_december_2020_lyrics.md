**Verse 1**\
In December twenty-twenty, we saw the dawn,\
Kusama soared, a new era drawn.\
Validator set expanding, one by one,\
Nine hundred dreams under the sun.

A canary flying in the blockchain sky,\
Testing grounds where futures lie.\
Rococo whispers of parachain light,\
Plasm emerges, igniting the night.

**Chorus**\
Kusama, oh Kusama, lead us on the path,\
A beacon of change, steering from the past.\
In the heart of Polkadot, your story's cast,\
December twenty-twenty, your moment vast.

**Verse 2**\
Amidst the roar of the crypto crowd,\
KSM stood resilient and proud.\
Forty proposals took flight like birds,\
A treasury fueling innovative words.

Developer dreams in vibrant hues,\
KILT Protocol breaking through.\
Kusama, not just a testnet name,\
But a force that's changing the blockchain game.

**Chorus**\
Kusama, oh Kusama, lead us on the path,\
A beacon of change, steering from the past.\
In the heart of Polkadot, your story's cast,\
December twenty-twenty, your moment vast.

**Outro**\
The future's bright, from sky to sea,\
With Kusama paving the way for harmony.\
In the echoes of December, we'll find our song,\
In the dance of networks, where we all belong.
