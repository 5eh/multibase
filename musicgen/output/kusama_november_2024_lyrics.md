(Verse 1)  
In November twenty twenty-four,  
Kusama roars with might once more.  
A canary sings in blockchain skies,  
Crashing through the growth's surprise.  

Asynchronous dreams, scaling wide,  
Parachains rise, align with pride.  
DecentraHealth, EcoChain too,  
QuantumLeap secures the view.  

(Chorus)  
Oh Kusama, where the future lies,  
Pushing limits, reaching for the skies.  
Innovation flows, you pave the way,  
In November, let your colors sway.  

(Verse 2)  
Community votes in KIP dreams,  
Strength in numbers, breaking seams.  
A vibrant pulse where changes bleed,  
The heart of blockchain's daring creed.  

Acala, Karura, networks blend,  
Wormhole links as barriers bend.  
SubQuery's voice, Parallel's strive,  
In Kusama, the future thrives.  

(Chorus)  
Oh Kusama, where the future lies,  
Pushing limits, reaching for the skies.  
Innovation flows, you pave the way,  
In November, let your colors sway.
