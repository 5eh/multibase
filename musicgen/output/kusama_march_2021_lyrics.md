**Title: March of Kusama**

**Verse 1:**  
In the dawn of March twenty-one,  
Kusama rises with the sun,  
A thousand voices, validators strong,  
Decentralized dreams moving along.  

Auctions whisper through the chain,  
Parachain slots, a bold campaign.  
Projects gather, crowdloans ignite,  
Building futures, reaching new heights.  

**Chorus:**  
Oh March 2021, where visions soar,  
In Kusama's heart, we explore.  
Breaking chains and pushing bounds,  
In this canary, innovation resounds.  

**Verse 2:**  
Runtime upgrades, v0.8.29,  
Technical triumphs, stars align.  
Shell parachain, the message sends,  
Relay chain tested, strength transcends.  

KSM's soaring, market ablaze,  
From modest start to meteoric praise.  
Tokens fly on speculation's wings,  
In Kusama's realm, the future sings.  

**Chorus:**  
Oh March 2021, where visions soar,  
In Kusama's heart, we explore.  
Breaking chains and pushing bounds,  
In this canary, innovation resounds.  

**Bridge:**  
Kusama stands, a testing ground,  
For Polkadot's future, profoundly renowned.  
March left its mark, the world could see,  
A decentralized dream, set free.  

**Chorus:**  
Oh March 2021, where visions soar,  
In Kusama's heart, we explore.  
Breaking chains and pushing bounds,  
In this canary, innovation resounds.
