# Kusama's Bold December Strides Steers Blockchain Into Uncharted Territory

**Fast-evolving 'Canary Network' Kusama Pushes Boundaries of Blockchain Development and Governance in Surge of December Activity**

Kusama network made a decisive leap into the public realm in December 2019, launching as an experimental platform parallel to the esteemed Polkadot system. Dubbed as a 'canary network' in the blockchain mines, it aims to be a high-stakes test ground for radical innovation, deftly serving developers and projects seeking a quick trial-and-error process before the final Polkadot deployment.

## Kusama's Effortless Shift to OpenGov Marks Blockchain Milestone

In an unprecedented move reflecting its organic ability to comfortably morph, Kusama made a seamless transition from a permissioned proof-of-authority system controlled largely by the Web3 Foundation, to a decentralized proof-of-stake one in December. This significant shift opened up staking and brought about meaningful governance to a larger audience. 

Dr. Gavin Wood, founder of Polkadot and ex-CTO of Ethereum, considers this Kusama's experiment-focused philosophy, pushing blockchain limits without pragmatic stability constraints applied to high-value applications.  

## Soaring Parachain Auctions Bode Well for Kusama's Growth

Kusama's main attraction is the vibrantly active Parachain Auctions. They offer projects a practical opportunity to secure a parachain slot on the network for a given period, following which, the project’s community decides to extend the lease or move the project to a different network. 

These auctions result in a fascinating competitive environment encapsulating proof of the project's effectiveness, credibility, and community support, thus bolstering Kusama's standings in the market. 

## Kusama's Kiwi Technical Developments Raise the Bar

Despite mirroring Polkadot’s codebase, Kusama's scalable multi-chain architecture known as the 'parachains' aims to rectify underlying blockchain interoperability issues. With over 20 runtime upgrades, December witnessed the successful launch and operation of key features that included the acclaimed Nominated Proof-of-Stake (NPoS) consensus and the on-chain governance with referenda and council elections.

This breakneck pace of development is typically considered risky in a production blockchain, thereby unequivocally underlining Kusama's position as an active experimental stage.

## Market Performance: KSM Token High on Activity

December was also notable for the KSM token’s market debut at an initial trading price of around $1.71. Its distribution, mirroring Polkadot's DOT token, allowed people partaking in the Polkadot sale to claim an equal volume of KSM. This move, forecasted to lead to the synchronization between the two ecosystems, saw the Web3 Foundation holding back a few tokens for future incentives and development.

## Thriving Developer Ecosystem Emerges Out in the Open

Finally making a splash, Kusama's winning attribute of low entry barriers coupled with faster governance processes attracted the developer community radiantly. Projects such as Acala Network, Robonomics, and Chainlink announced deployment on Kusama, hinting at the vast potential and dynamism radiating from this nascent network.

Driven by this positive response, Web3 Foundation propelled further adoption by launching initiatives that include a $100,000 grant for network-building projects and the Kusama Faucet to funnel smaller amounts of KSM to budding developers.

## Tip of the Iceberg: Kusama's Promising Future

Advancing into 2020, the Kusama team envisions a challenging roadmap comprising an efficient integration of advanced cross-chain messaging protocols, an enhanced toolset for parachain developers, and a broader validator set and staking participation.

As per Dr. Wood, the end goal for growth remains firmly in their sights. "While Polkadot aims to be the bedrock for critical decentralized infrastructure, Kusama will always be the playground for radical innovation in blockchain technology. We expect it to evolve in ways we can't even imagine today," he tells our Blockchain Times reporter.

Despite being in its infancy, this December surge marks a significant stride in the evolution of Kusama. Its success further amplifies the possibilities of technological advancements in the blockchain market over the coming years.
