**Verse 1**\
In January 2020, the darkness came,\
Kusama stalled in error's name.\
Polkadot dreams on Kusama's wing,\
A canary's heart that dares to sing.

Eight days of shadows, eight nights long,\
The team of minds made right the wrong.\
From Polkadot to parachains,\
Resilience forged through trials and pains.

**Chorus**\
Rise, Kusama, rise,\
Through the storm, we'll touch the skies.\
In a world where dreams collide,\
Kusama's heart will be our guide.

**Verse 2**\
OpenGov's hand steadied the course,\
Validator slots in steady force.\
Unruffled tides of investor dreams,\
KSM token's soaring beams.

Developers gather, stories bloom,\
In Kusama's vibrant digital room.\
Past the chaos, stronger we stand,\
A future built on Kusama's land.

**Chorus**\
Rise, Kusama, rise,\
Through the storm, we'll touch the skies.\
In a world where dreams collide,\
Kusama's heart will be our guide.
