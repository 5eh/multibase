**Verse 1:**  
In June 2021, the dawn of a new age,  
Kusama broke the chains, on the blockchain stage.  
Parachains ignited, blazing through the night,  
Scalable dreams took flight, in the digital light.  

Council's vision soared, Shell transformed to Statemine,  
Fungible, non-fungible, all dreams intertwined.  
Gavin Wood's echo, in the realm of blockchain dreams,  
A world of innovation, where the future gleams.  

**Chorus:**  
Oh, Kusama, carve the path anew,  
Parachain auctions, the world turns to you.  
In June’s fiery glow, the ecosystem soared,  
Scalable futures, dreams explored.  

**Verse 2:**  
Bidding wars raged, Karura, Moonriver in the mix,  
Projects racing forward, with customized tricks.  
Tokens climbed the ladder, KSM's rise was steep,  
Visionaries united, as blockchain’s heartbeats leap.  

The OpenGov thundered, the horizon expanded,  
A canary's song, with innovation branded.  
As the auctions quiet, futures are in view,  
Polkadot waits steady, for paths forged anew.  

**Chorus:**  
Oh, Kusama, carve the path anew,  
Parachain auctions, the world turns to you.  
In June’s fiery glow, the ecosystem soared,  
Scalable futures, dreams explored.  

**Outro:**  
June 2021, the legacy we weave,  
In the blockchain’s rhythm, we believe.  
Kusama’s anthem, a song of the brave,  
The digital frontier, the new path we pave.
