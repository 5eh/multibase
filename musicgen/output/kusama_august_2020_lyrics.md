**Verse 1:**

In August 2020, a spark began to burn,\
Kusama roared to life, risk and lessons to learn.\
Gov 2.0 redefined, with voices amplified,\
Decentralized dreams, in our hearts reside.

Parachains set the stage, for the great ascent,\
Auctioned slots, changing the present.\
Statemine promised, assets to deploy,\
Tokens and coins, Kusama to enjoy.

**Chorus:**

Kusama, fly high, where eagles dare,\
In the canary's flight, a vision so rare.\
With chains interwoven, a dance in the sky,\
August 2020, watch Kusama rise.

**Verse 2:**

Crab on the prowl, networks intertwine,\
Cross-chain ideas, on the frontier line.\
Smart contracts whisper, the future's song,\
Innovation echoes, in the Kusama throng.

KSM in motion, a market’s bright fuse,\
Ecosystem blossoms, with a thousand hues.\
Developers gather, for the Hackusama call,\
A tapestry of code, Kusama stands tall.

**Chorus:**

Kusama, fly high, where eagles dare,\
In the canary's flight, a vision so rare.\
With chains interwoven, a dance in the sky,\
August 2020, watch Kusama rise.

**Bridge:**

Boundless potential, woven threads align,\
Future's built today, on Kusama’s design.\
Evolving governance, a collective’s pride,\
With every milestone crossed, onward we glide.

**Chorus:**

Kusama, fly high, where eagles dare,\
In the canary's flight, a vision so rare.\
With chains interwoven, a dance in the sky,\
August 2020, watch Kusama rise.
