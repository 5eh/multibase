**Verse 1:**

In February '24, we watched dreams take flight,  
Kusama blazing trails, a beacon in the night.  
BEEFY bridges built, weaving chains so wide,  
A dance with Ethereum, worlds now collide.  
Through Snowbridge whispers, Hyperbridge calls,  
Connecting hearts and minds as the barrier falls.  

**Chorus:**

Kusama, rise above, reach beyond the skies,  
A world of endless links where innovation lies.  
In the heart of blockchain, your spirit shines so bright,  
February '24, rewriting dawn's light.  

**Verse 2:**

Community voices strong, echo in the halls,  
Zug Crypto Nights where the restless hearts enthrall.  
Parachains evolving, pushing boundaries near,  
With Agile Coretimeâ€™s grace, developers draw near.  
Governance in motion, every vote a key,  
In the hands of dreamers, shaping destiny.  

**Chorus:**

Kusama, rise above, reach beyond the skies,  
A world of endless links where innovation lies.  
In the heart of blockchain, your spirit shines so bright,  
February '24, rewriting dawn's light.  

**Bridge:**  

Though markets may falter, your resilience stands,  
Interwoven dreams crafted by gifted hands.  

**Chorus:**

Kusama, rise above, reach beyond the skies,  
A world of endless links where innovation lies.  
In the heart of blockchain, your spirit shines so bright,  
February '24, rewriting dawn's light.
