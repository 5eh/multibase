**Verse 1**  
In February '24, a new dawn's rise,  
Kusama's dream, a fire in the skies.  
BEEFY bridges building pathways wide,  
Connecting chains, a seamless ride.  

Parachains auction, time to realign,  
Agile Coretime, four weeks to find.  
Resources shift, like tides they flow,  
In this digital sea, let our vision grow.  

**Chorus**  
Revolution's calling, echoes in the air,  
Kusama's spirit, a world to share.  
Pioneers of change, under the stars,  
Blockchain's future, written in our hearts.  

**Verse 2**  
Snowbridge and Hyperbridge, secure and strong,  
EVM chains where they belong.  
Polkadotâ€™s canary, leading the flight,  
Through innovative days and vibrant nights.  

Communities gather, Crypto Nights ignite,  
Sharing knowledge, with open sight.  
The heartbeat of Web 3.0,  
In Kusama's world, we boldly go.  

**Chorus**  
Revolution's calling, echoes in the air,  
Kusama's spirit, a world to share.  
Pioneers of change, under the stars,  
Blockchain's future, written in our hearts.  

**Bridge**  
Interlinked pathways, crossing time and space,  
Kusama's vision, an embraced embrace.  
Innovation whispers, in the winds of change,  
In February '24, nothing stays the same.  

**Chorus**  
Revolution's calling, echoes in the air,  
Kusama's spirit, a world to share.  
Pioneers of change, under the stars,  
Blockchain's future, written in our hearts.
