**Verse 1**  
February 2021, a new dawn breaks,  
Kusama's leap like a wild heart shakes.  
700 strong, validators rise,  
In the realm of blockchain skies.  

Governance shifts, a collective's voice,  
NPoS leads the way, we've made our choice.  
KSM climbing, bullish light,  
From humble roots, we take flight.

**Chorus**  
Kusama's heart beats, in a world unknown,  
A wild cousin where dreams are sown.  
Parachain whispers, auctions call,  
A multi-chain future in February's thrall.

**Verse 2**  
Slots open wide, innovation flows,  
Projects converge where the wild wind blows.  
Lower barriers, a welcoming hand,  
Building new worlds, where visions expand.

Technical strides, the foundation laid,  
Decentralized dreams, from which we're made.  
In the pulse of change, developers bloom,  
Kusama's future, dispelling gloom.

**Chorus**  
Kusama's heart beats, in a world unknown,  
A wild cousin where dreams are sown.  
Parachain whispers, auctions call,  
A multi-chain future in February's thrall.  

**Outro**  
February 2021, a turning point clear,  
Kusama's journey, we hold dear.  
Together we rise, we boldly run,  
In the endless race towards the sun.
