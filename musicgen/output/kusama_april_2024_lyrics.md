**Verse 1:**
In April '24, Kusama soared,  
Breaking chains, rewriting lore,  
Agile Coretime, a vision's flight,  
Sold out the cores, igniting the night.  

Dynamic change, no slots to bind,  
Opens doors for the agile mind,  
Turing's dreams of DeFi rise,  
Cross-chain bridges reach new skies.  

**Chorus:**  
Oh, Kusama, canary's call,  
In the blockchain, you're standing tall.  
Guide us through the night once more,  
April '24, we hear your roar.  

**Verse 2:**  
Asynchronous Backing on the brink,  
Faster blocks, with one thought, we sync.  
KSM's journey, climbing high,  
Bullish trends with wings to fly.  

Community's voice, a governance tale,  
Assets cross the Polkadot trail.  
In this realm of code and dreams,  
Kusama leads where the future beams.  

**Chorus:**  
Oh, Kusama, canary's call,  
In the blockchain, you're standing tall.  
Guide us through the night once more,  
April '24, we hear your roar.  

**Outro:**  
Forging paths with every stride,  
In your hands, we choose to glide.  
Kusama's echo, the world will know,  
On this journey, forever we'll go.
