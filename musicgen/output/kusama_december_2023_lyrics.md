**Verse 1**  
In the realm of code and dreams,  
Kusama lights the way it seems,  
OpenGov in full command,  
Voices unite across this land.  
  
Parachain auctions blaze the trail,  
Forty strong and never pale.  
Ecosystem grows and thrives,  
Breathing life, where dreams arise.  
  
**Chorus**  
Oh, December 2023,  
Kusama writes our destiny.  
Through the storm, we stand so bold,  
In the world of blockchain gold.  
  
**Verse 2**  
Messages cross on restless streams,  
Seventeen thousand, chasing dreams.  
The XCM, our bridge of hope,  
Scales the heights, helps us cope.  
  
KSM stands through thick and thin,  
In the crypto world, we spin.  
Developers carve the path ahead,  
With Shytoshiâ€™s dreams widespread.  
  
**Chorus**  
Oh, December 2023,  
Kusama writes our destiny.  
Through the storm, we stand so bold,  
In the world of blockchain gold.  
  
**Outro**  
As we look to twenty-four,  
Kusama promises much more.  
Scalable dreams and bonds will form,  
In this revolution's dawn.
