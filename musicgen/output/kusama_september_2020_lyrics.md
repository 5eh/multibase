**Verse 1**\
In September 2020, the canaries sing,\
Emerging strong from Polkadot's wing.\
A playground bold, for the daring souls,\
Innovation thrives where Kusama rolls.

Governance takes its rightful stage,\
Testing the limits, turning the page.\
Proposals fly, progress aligns,\
A thriving land where the future shines.

**Chorus**\
Oh, Kusama, you rise and soar,\
A canary loud in blockchain's core.\
New heights reached, in moons of gold,\
A beacon bright as dreams unfold.

**Verse 2**\
Parachains racing, a fervent dance,\
Hackusama's call, a daring prance.\
Unique visions, framed in code,\
In this sandbox, the world is told.

KSM climbs, a soaring flight,\
From the depths to dizzying heights.\
Developers dream, in networks vast,\
Building a future meant to last.

**Chorus**\
Oh, Kusama, you rise and soar,\
A canary loud in blockchain's core.\
New heights reached, in moons of gold,\
A beacon bright as dreams unfold.

**Bridge**\
With Gavin's vision, on wings of change,\
A vibrant chorus in blockchain's range.\
Interlinked paths, new frontiers found,\
A testing ground where hope abounds.

**Chorus**\
Oh, Kusama, you rise and soar,\
A canary loud in blockchain's core.\
New heights reached, in moons of gold,\
A beacon bright as dreams unfold.

**Outro**\
Oh, Kusama, fly high,\
In the boundless blockchain sky.\
September's song in memories' vault,\
As the future we exalt.
