**Verse 1**  
In May 2021, the tide began to turn,  
Kusama's wings spread wide, ready to learn.  
Governance blossomed, proposals in bloom,  
CHAOS called out, igniting the room.  
Parachains on the horizon, the next frontier,  
In agile strides, the future draws near.

**Chorus**  
Unstoppable force, Kusama flies,  
Through turbulent markets, reaching new skies.  
A beacon of change in a world unknown,  
Kusama's heart beats, carving its own.  

**Verse 2**  
Tech visions soared, as upgrades rolled,  
Scalability dreams that never grew old.  
Amid the fray, KSM took flight,  
Record highs broke the market's night.  
Community strong, with eyes on the prize,  
In this brave new world, the potential lies.

**Chorus**  
Unstoppable force, Kusama flies,  
Through turbulent markets, reaching new skies.  
A beacon of change in a world unknown,  
Kusama's heart beats, carving its own.

**Bridge**  
Anticipation builds, a collective dream,  
Innovative paths, where none have been.  
June looms ahead, the auctions await,  
For Kusama's journey to greatness, we celebrate.

**Chorus**  
Unstoppable force, Kusama flies,  
Through turbulent markets, reaching new skies.  
A beacon of change in a world unknown,  
Kusama's heart beats, carving its own.  

May 2021, a moment that shone,  
The dawn of Kusama, forever known.
