**Verse 1**  
In August '24, the frontier of dreams,  
Kusama reigns where the blockchain gleams.  
OpenGov rises, new voices take flight,  
Weighted voting, a beacon of light.  

Nebula shines, the code breaks through,  
Parachains grow, like seeds in the dew.  
DeFi Hub and QuantumLeap's call,  
A future unfolds at Kusama's hall.  

**Chorus**  
In the heart of revolution, where the wild ones play,  
Kusama's dreamers light the way.  
Governance, freedom in the air,  
A blockchain dance, we dare, we dare.  

**Verse 2**  
Tokens hold steady through turbulent seas,  
â‚¬17.95, a tale of beliefs.  
In the pulse of auctions, a million staked strong,  
Community builds as we march on.  

Cross-chain threads weave the web,  
Developer hands shape what's ahead.  
Karura and Moonriver's bright spark,  
Kusama guides through innovation's dark.  

**Chorus**  
In the heart of revolution, where the wild ones play,  
Kusama's dreamers light the way.  
Governance, freedom in the air,  
A blockchain dance, we dare, we dare.  

**Outro**  
The future's edge, with tech in its hand,  
Kusama stands, where we understand.  
A launchpad of hope, a proving ground,  
In August '24, we hear the sound.
