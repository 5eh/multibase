**Verse 1:**  
In the heart of March '25,  
Kusama's star began to rise,  
Governance shifted, a bold new way,  
HyperScale's power led the dance,  
Transactions flew, a tenfold chance,  
Dr. Wood's vision lights the day.  

**Chorus:**  
Building bridges, blockchain dreams,  
Kusama's fire in the seams,  
Innovate, elevate, future untold,  
In a digital world, new stories unfold.  

**Verse 2:**  
Parachains bid for a place to grow,  
DecentAI leads, with bright eyes aglow,  
KSM rides the market's sea,  
Amidst the highs, amidst the lows,  
ZeroTrace whispers secrets unknown,  
Kusama weaves its destiny.  

**Chorus:**  
Building bridges, blockchain dreams,  
Kusama's fire in the seams,  
Innovate, elevate, future untold,  
In a digital world, new stories unfold.  

**Bridge:**  
Cross-chain paths, Kusama's call,  
A stablecoin dream to end it all,  
Decentralized future, roadmaps to see,  
Crafting a world where we're all free.  

**Chorus:**  
Building bridges, blockchain dreams,  
Kusama's fire in the seams,  
Innovate, elevate, future untold,  
In a digital world, new stories unfold.  

**Outro:**  
In the heart of March '25,  
Kusama's journey comes alive.
