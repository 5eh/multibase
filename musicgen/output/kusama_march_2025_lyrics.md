**Verse 1:**\
March 2025, in a canary's flight,\
Through the blockchain skies, we see the light,\
KIP-2025-03 stands tall,\
Privacy and governance, answering the call.

Velocity races with a heartbeat's pace,\
Fifteen thousand strong, in digital space,\
A thriving network, weaving dreams,\
In a chain of blocks, endless streams.

**Chorus:**\
Oh Kusama, breaking chains and setting free,\
In the heart of March 2025's melody,\
Building bridges, where tech dreams glide,\
Future-bound, our worlds collide.

**Verse 2:**\
Quantum leaps in auctions' embrace,\
With KSM tokens, taking the race,\
Newcomers rise, NeoFinance, MetaKusama's realm,\
In an ocean of codes, they take the helm.

Karura flows, with seamless ties,\
Shiden’s rapid roads, under open skies,\
Khala whispers secrets untold,\
In confidential coding, futures unfold.

**Chorus:**\
Oh Kusama, breaking chains and setting free,\
In the heart of March 2025's melody,\
Building bridges, where tech dreams glide,\
Future-bound, our worlds collide.

**Outro:**\
Resilient KSM, amidst the stormy seas,\
Trade winds blow with courage and ease,\
With innovation’s dawn on every shore,\
Kusama sails, forevermore.
