**Chorus:**\
In the year of dreams, January '21,\
Kusama rose like a blazing sun.\
Parachains and visions align,\
Open governance, the stars did shine.

**Verse 1:**\
Playground for the bold, a testing ground,\
In the web of chains, new paths are found.\
Democracy reigns in digital streams,\
Community voices, building bold dreams.

Riding high on the wings of change,\
Technological growth, breaking the cage.\
From a token's humble start, it soared,\
A crypto winner, it was adored.

**Chorus:**\
In the year of dreams, January '21,\
Kusama rose like a blazing sun.\
Parachains and visions align,\
Open governance, the stars did shine.

**Verse 2:**\
Auctions sparked the fire, hearts ablaze,\
Projects racing to the relay chain's embrace.\
Developers gather, daring to try,\
Innovations blooming, reaching the sky.

Bridging worlds, a scalable dream,\
Kusama's growth, an unstoppable stream.\
As tech and minds intertwined,\
A decentralized future, realigned.

**Chorus:**\
In the year of dreams, January '21,\
Kusama rose like a blazing sun.\
Parachains and visions align,\
Open governance, the stars did shine.

**Outro:**\
Onward, ever upward, spirits free,\
Kusama's legacy, forever we see.\
January's echoes, a powerful tune,\
Into the future, beneath the moon.
