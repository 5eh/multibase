**Verse 1**  
November 2020, skies are high,  
Kusama soars, wild cousin in its eye.  
Validator dreams as numbers rise,  
From 900 surged to touch the skies.  
XCMP lights the way,  
Shards in harmony, here to stay.  
Gavinâ€™s vision, echoes strong,  
Through Polkadot, the canary's song.

**Chorus**  
Oh, Kusama, where developers roam,  
A testing ground, now a home.  
Parachains bid with fervor bright,  
In the blockchain's endless night.  
Oh, KSM, let your value shine,  
In the canary's heart, futures intertwine.

**Verse 2**  
Picasso paints in DeFi's hues,  
Composable Finance makes its debut.  
Subsocial weaves a network grand,  
Kilt Protocol steadies on the sand.  
Ethereum whispers, bridges mend,  
In Kusama, on this we depend.  
Market climbs on hopeful wings,  
November dances as Kusama sings.

**Chorus**  
Oh, Kusama, where developers roam,  
A testing ground, now a home.  
Parachains bid with fervor bright,  
In the blockchain's endless night.  
Oh, KSM, let your value shine,  
In the canary's heart, futures intertwine.

**Outro**  
Boundaries pushed, technology's edge,  
Kusama reigns, a pledge.  
Beyond a test, it grows, it thrives,  
In this network, hope survives.
