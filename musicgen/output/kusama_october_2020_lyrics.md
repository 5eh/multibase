**Title: Soaring on the Edge**

**Verse 1:**  
In October 2020, skies began to roar,  
Kusama flew high, where dreams explore.  
Governance awake, the council speaks,  
Shaping the code as the future peaks.  

Validator visions, changing the game,  
Echoes of progress, igniting the flame.  
Blocks and chain, a tapestry bold,  
In the wilder Web 3.0, stories unfold.  

**Chorus:**  
Kusama, soaring on the edge,  
Where innovation and community pledge.  
Parachains, tethered dreams,  
In a network of hopes and themes.  
Kusama, where the future flies,  
Under October’s open skies.  

**Verse 2:**  
Auction fever, the bids arise,  
For slots in chains, where futures lie.  
Projects of promise, they yearn to win,  
Acala, Moonbeam, Plasm, let the games begin.  

KSM, steadfast through volatile tides,  
A token of strength where the heart abides.  
Developers crafting, in code they weave,  
A vibrant tapestry, as we believe.  

**Chorus:**  
Kusama, soaring on the edge,  
Where innovation and community pledge.  
Parachains, tethered dreams,  
In a network of hopes and themes.  
Kusama, where the future flies,  
Under October’s open skies.  

**Outro:**  
Ever-evolving, a journey untamed,  
In the blockchain world, Kusama is named.  
October 2020, marked in time,  
A bold frontier, where ambitions climb.
