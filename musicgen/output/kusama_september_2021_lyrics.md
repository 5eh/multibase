**Verse 1**  
In September twenty twenty-one,  
Kusama's wings began to run,  
Parachains in rhythm, lights ignite,  
In chaotic dance, they blaze the night.  

Governance steers with a coded hand,  
Democracy blooms across the land,  
Community voices, loud and clear,  
Reflections of trust, no fear.  

**Chorus**  
Oh, Kusama, in this vibrant September,  
Blooming paths we all remember,  
Innovate, elevate, rise again,  
Future's ours to shape, my friend.  

**Verse 2**  
KILT secured, with trust and grace,  
Crowdloans' power in this space,  
Karura's DeFi, Moonriver's light,  
Dreams of a web3 taking flight.  

KSM surges, hearts ignite,  
Markets cheer under blockchain light,  
A haven for those who dare,  
Kusama's dream, beyond compare.  

**Chorus**  
Oh, Kusama, in this vibrant September,  
Blooming paths we all remember,  
Innovate, elevate, rise again,  
Future's ours to shape, my friend.  

**Bridge**  
As Polkadot waits in the wings,  
Kusama tests, and the future sings,  
A symbiotic dance, they weave,  
In every heart, ideas conceive.  

**Outro**  
Bright horizons, paths yet untold,  
In Kusamaâ€™s arms, we are bold,  
A future forged in code and dream,  
Kusama leads, watch it gleam.
