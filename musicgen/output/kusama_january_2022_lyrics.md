**Verse 1**  
In January twenty-two, a new dawn breaks,  
Kusama's wings take flight despite the shakes.  
Parachains in line, ready to ignite,  
Governance rising, with on-chain might.  

Validator dreams in tech's embrace,  
Scaling up with nimble, rapid pace.  
Cross-chain whispers, bridges to span,  
A sandbox for dreams, broadening the clan.

**Chorus**  
Oh Kusama, canary in the storm,  
In the wild of change, your heart stays warm.  
Through the cryptic tides, you find your way,  
Building bridges to a brighter day.

**Verse 2**  
Market dreams dance through highs and lows,  
Tokens tremble where the current flows.  
Yet optimism holds, with visions clear,  
Polkadot by your side, no need to fear.  

Bidding for a future, parachains unite,  
Innovations sprout in January's light.  
On this vast canvas, developers paint,  
A thriving ecosystem you cultivate.

**Chorus**  
Oh Kusama, canary in the storm,  
In the wild of change, your heart stays warm.  
Through the cryptic tides, you find your way,  
Building bridges to a brighter day.

**Bridge**  
Treasures of code, in a sandbox of dreams,  
Hackathons, bounties, nurturing streams.  
Beyond the chaos, a path you trace,  
Guiding the future, at a breakneck pace.  

**Chorus**  
Oh Kusama, canary in the storm,  
In the wild of change, your heart stays warm.  
Through the cryptic tides, you find your way,  
Building bridges to a brighter day.
