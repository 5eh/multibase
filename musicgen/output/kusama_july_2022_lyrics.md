**Verse 1**\
In July 2022, the chains came alive,\
Kusama's heart in a digital drive.\
OpenGov rising, a fresh chapter's call,\
Breaking down walls, no hierarchy at all.

Parachain dreams, a dozen to soar,\
Developers pushing, wanting to explore.\
In the land of the wild, where tech's untamed,\
KSM swings, in the market's game.

**Chorus**\
Oh, Kusama, bold and free,\
Wild cousin in this blockchain sea.\
Ride the waves of July's thrill,\
In this future, we build and fulfill.

**Verse 2**\
Statemine's blessing, parachains ignite,\
Mogwai and Snow dance in the light.\
Common-good chains, a shared frontier,\
A decentralized world, so near.

Calamari whispers secrets to keep,\
Shiden's smart contracts, dreams that leap.\
Volatile tides, KSM's plight,\
Yet investors hold, through day and night.

**Chorus**\
Oh, Kusama, bold and free,\
Wild cousin in this blockchain sea.\
Ride the waves of July's thrill,\
In this future, we build and fulfill.

**Bridge**\
Asynchronous Backing, futures we mold,\
In Kusama's hands, wonders unfold.\
Polkadot echoes, in the paths we find,\
A decentralized song, in the heart and mind.

**Outro**\
July 2022, a time to remember,\
Kusama's spirit, an eternal ember.\
Oh, Kusama, bold and free,\
Forever wild, in our blockchain legacy.
