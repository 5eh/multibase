# Kusama News - August 2020

# Kusama Surges with Development Milestones and Ecosystem Expansion

In August 2020, Kusama, a pioneering, risk-taking iteration of the Polkadot project, experienced notable expansion. The blockchain community has seen increased interest in Kusama due to its approach in pushing the blockchain paradigms forward.

## "Gov 2.0": Advancements in Kusama's Open Governance Structure

August marked significant advancements in Kusama's open governance system, embracing a more decentralized and community-centric approach. Kusama, often dubbed as a "canary network" for Polkadot, is seen as a vanguard, testing innovative enhancements in its governance system before Polkadot's implementation.

On the community front, Kusama moved into an enhanced mode of Decentralized Autonomous Organization. This innovative, community-driven model represented a departure from a typical, bureaucratic model, signaling Kusama's commitment to rapid, decentralized decision-making.

## Parachain Expansion Marks Kusama's Rising Growth

August 2020 observed Kusama implementing parachain slot auctions, a primary step towards its growth trajectory. Parachains are independent blockchains that run parallel to the main Kusama chain. Kusama's work on slot auctions paved the way for high-quality onboarding of projects onto its network in the future.

Statemine, a generic asset parachain in Kusama, though still under development in August 2020, marked further advancements, promising to facilitate the deployment of diverse assets such as stablecoins, fungible tokens, and non-fungible tokens.

## Technical Trends Propel Kusama's Innovation Frontier

August was a dynamic month for Kusama on the technological front. With emergence of projects like Darwinia’s Crab Network, Kusama has been steering towards native support for cross-chain functionality and smart contracts.

The continuous evolution in Kusama's technical arsenal demonstrated the project's commitment to nurturing a vibrant, innovation-driven environment, opening up distinct new opportunities in the blockchain arena.

## KSM Token Activity Spotlights Market Insight

August 2020 was marked by a considerable activity for Kusama's native token, the KSM. On August 11, 2020, KSM witnessed buzzing trading on cryptocurrency exchanges. The surge in investor interest came from an ever-expanding ecosystem coupled with promising technology updates.

## Developer Ecosystem Showcases Kusama's Project Prowess

Kusama's vision to fortify the developer ecosystem was made evident in August 2020. With burgeoning projects aiming to capitalize on Kusama’s multi-chain architecture, a decentralized exchange built using substrate, and a platform for crowdfunding bounties on Kusama projects were among those that showcased the innovative strength of Kusama’s environment.

## Looking Ahead: Kusama’s Positioning for Future Growth

Kusama, towards the end of August 2020, seemed to be priming itself for significant expansion. With more parachain auctions in the pipeline and the success of Hackusama attracting more developers to the ecosystem, Kusama demonstrated its alignment with its primary vision of unlocking the full potential of its interoperable, multi-chain architecture.

Concluding August, Kusama's growth, marked by its technical advancements, governance enhancements, and ecosystem expansion, signals its increasing relevance in the blockchain world.
