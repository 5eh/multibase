# Kusama Sees Surge in Innovation Amidst Crypto Downtrend

Under the shadow of a sluggish cryptocurrency market in September 2022, Kusama, fondly referred to as Polkadot's "canary network", exhibited remarkable resilience by pushing through with significant developments and community initiatives.

## Open Governance to Empower Kusama's Community

In September, Kusama announced an upcoming overhaul of its governance structure aimed at significantly increasing community involvement and decentralization. The details were disclosed by Polkadot and Kusama’s founder, Gavin Wood, during the Polkadot Decoded 2022 conference. 

The updates are expected to broaden the range of decisions the on-chain governance system can handle. In addition, new mechanisms to foster inclusivity within the platform are to be implemented. Gavin Wood said, “this represents a significant shift in how Kusama and Polkadot will be governed, and it is a step towards our goal of gradually decentralizing control of these networks.”

Implementation of these changes hedges on community approval in the coming weeks and is anticipated to be rolled out with the v0.9.30 runtime upgrade.

## Kusama's Flourishing Parachain Ecosystem

Last September saw continued growth and expansion across Kusama's parachain ecosystem, with noteworthy projects like Karura, Moonriver, and Shiden Network pushing forward with new functionalities and integrations.

Acala and Karura, DeFi infrastructures within Polkadot and Kusama, announced plans to work with Wormhole, one of the most extensive cross-chain bridges in the crypto domain. This is a step towards achieving their vision of a multi-chain future and in facilitating interoperability within the Kusama/Polkadot ecosystems.

## Technological Innovations on Kusama

More technological advancements were witnessed on Kusama in September. Key enhancements to network performance, parachain auction mechanisms, and cross-chain messaging were implemented. One significant shift is the introduction of asynchronous backing, which is poised to markedly improve block times and throughput for parachains, enhancing scalability.

## KSM Token's Market Performance

The KSM token, however, mirrored the general crypto market performance in September, opening at around $50 and seeing substantial volatility before slightly recovering. Trading volumes remained relatively stable, with daily volumes averaging about $30 million.

## Emerging Projects in Kusama's Developer Ecosystem

The Kusama developer ecosystem was also not left out, with several developers and projects leveraging Moonriver's smart contract platform for its Ethereum compatibility.

## Looking Forward

Despite challenging market conditions, the Kusama community is looking forward to significant milestones, including the implementation of the new governance model and the continued evolution of the parachain ecosystem. As Dr. Wood emphasizes, "bear markets are for building. And on Kusama, we never stop building."

The resilience of Kusama in the midst of a struggling market reaffirms its position as a key player in the greater Polkadot ecosystem. As the crypto industry continues to evolve, Kusama's role in spearheading innovation remains pivotal.
