**Verse 1:**

In December 2019, a canary takes its flight,\
Born from chaos, a beacon in the night,\
Kusama calls with wings open wide,\
Pioneers gather, on this wild ride.

Proof-of-stake, the way is clear,\
In the hands of rebels, we fight the fear,\
Validators join, our numbers grow,\
Rising tides, in the blockchain’s flow.

**Chorus:**

In the heart of the storm, we find our grace,\
Kusama leads us through this space,\
Where chaos reigns, innovation breathes,\
In December's shadow, we sow the seeds.

**Verse 2:**

Parachains await, the auctions ignite,\
Dreamers bid, in the fading light,\
Acala and Chainlink, cast their nets,\
Lower barriers, no regrets.

Governance in every hand,\
A symphony of change, so boldly planned,\
December remembers the first step we made,\
Kusama’s promise in the futures we trade.

**Chorus:**

In the heart of the storm, we find our grace,\
Kusama leads us through this space,\
Where chaos reigns, innovation breathes,\
In December's shadow, we sow the seeds.

**Outro:**

A whispered tale, of brave new days,\
Kusama's path, a guiding blaze,\
With wings of courage, we write our fate,\
As the world watches, we elevate.
