**Verse 1:**\
In the heart of change, May met its match,\
Kusama's stage, where futures hatch.\
OpenGov, tearing the old walls down,\
A new governance, in the web of renown.\
Collective voices, in council we find,\
Dreams of transparency reshaping the mind.

**Chorus:**\
In May 2022, we rode the waves,\
Kusama's canary, we are the brave.\
Tokens tumbling like stars in the sky,\
An unpredictable dance where limits fly.\
Building blocks of innovation,\
Our hands craft a new foundation.

**Verse 2:**\
Parachains claim their rightful place,\
With crowdloans, they join the race.\
Thrill of the auction, new projects take flight,\
Cross-chain dreams in the night.\
Dr. Wood, the visionary seer,\
Nurturing evolution, dispelling fear.

**Chorus:**\
In May 2022, we rode the waves,\
Kusama's canary, we are the brave.\
Tokens tumbling like stars in the sky,\
An unpredictable dance where limits fly.\
Building blocks of innovation,\
Our hands craft a new foundation.

**Outro:**\
Kusama's journey, a path unknown,\
A bridge to dreams, or a throne of its own.\
As the world watches, we rise and sew,\
The future's fabric, in blockchain's glow.
