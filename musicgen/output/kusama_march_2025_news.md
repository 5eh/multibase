After a democratic community vote, Kusama has embraced a crucial governance
proposal, KIP-2025-03, that integrates advanced zero-knowledge proof technology
network-wide. The move adds a layer of privacy for Kusama users without
compromising the transparency vital to blockchain platforms. The proposition
enjoyed a sweeping 92% approval rate, reflecting Kusama's highly engaged
community and their dedication towards user privacy.

In other governance advancements, the network successfully launched the
code-named "Velocity" upgrade, significantly enhancing transaction processing
capabilities. The upgrade boosts the network's throughput by a whopping 300%,
with potential for 15,000 transactions per second. This development signals
another stride for the Kusama network towards a future of high-performance,
interoperable blockchains.
