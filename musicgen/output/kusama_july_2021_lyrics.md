**Chorus:**

In July 2021, a new dawn rose,\
Kusama's spirit unchained and bold.\
Parachains were won, dreams interlace,\
A blockchain journey to a vast, new space.

**Verse 1:**

Canary's song echoes through the night,\
OpenGov's hand, grasping the light.\
Statemine set free, NFTs in flow,\
Kusama's beating heart starts to glow.

Karura takes the first prized crown,\
Blocks emerge as systems unbound.\
Moonriver, Shiden, in vibrant chase,\
New paths carved in this digital race.

**Chorus:**

In July 2021, a new dawn rose,\
Kusama's spirit unchained and bold.\
Parachains were won, dreams interlace,\
A blockchain journey to a vast, new space.

**Verse 2:**

Cross-chain whispers, bridges of code,\
Kusama's promise, stories unfold.\
KSM rises, fervor ignites,\
In this web of chains, the future writes.

Developers dream on this fertile land,\
Interoperable visions, a guiding hand.\
Self-sovereign shadows stretch ahead,\
In Kusama's realm, pioneers tread.

**Chorus:**

In July 2021, a new dawn rose,\
Kusama's spirit unchained and bold.\
Parachains were won, dreams interlace,\
A blockchain journey to a vast, new space.

**Outro:**

A revolution sung in codes and dreams,\
Kusama's legacy, a widening stream.\
In the echoes of chains, the dance of the free,\
Kusama's tale shapes our destiny.
