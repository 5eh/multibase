**Verse 1:**

In the heart of May 2020, rise,\
Kusama's dream did touch the skies.\
Decentralized the way we vote,\
A fairer path, a future to promote.

Governance and growth in hand,\
Built on trust, a promise stands.\
Parachains on auction’s call,\
Interoperable visions for all.

**Chorus:**

Oh, Kusama, soaring high,\
A canary’s song in the blockchain sky.\
Innovation’s beacon, bright and bold,\
May 2020, your story unfolds.

**Verse 2:**

Hackusama sparked a light,\
Coded dreams took flight that night.\
Developers in a global embrace,\
Building chains in this wondrous space.

KSM rose like morning sun,\
Market's eye, a journey begun.\
Security and strength defined,\
In Kusama’s heart, a future aligned.

**Chorus:**

Oh, Kusama, soaring high,\
A canary’s song in the blockchain sky.\
Innovation’s beacon, bright and bold,\
May 2020, your story unfolds.

**Outro:**

As Polkadot waits on the near horizon,\
Kusama leads with visions to brighten.\
Carving paths where futures play,\
In the echoes of May 2020, we stay.
