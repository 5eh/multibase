**Verse 1**  
In July 2023, we rise,  
Kusama's dreams in our eyes,  
OpenGov lights the way,  
Token holders now hold sway.  
Parachains race the stars,  
Hackathons ignite like golden bars.  
Eastern winds and Mexican shores,  
Expanding frontiers, breaking doors.  

**Chorus**  
Canary dreams take flight,  
In the blockchain's endless night.  
Kusama's heart beats strong,  
In chaos we belong.  
Innovation's cradle, whole,  
July marked a future goal.  

**Verse 2**  
Consensus tests push the tide,  
Zero knowledge, secrets hide.  
Amid the crypto storm we stand,  
KSM holds, a steady hand.  
Chaotic threads, new debates,  
In this playground, we create.  
ShibaCon, on the horizon's edge,  
Into the future, a bold pledge.  

**Chorus**  
Canary dreams take flight,  
In the blockchain's endless night.  
Kusama's heart beats strong,  
In chaos we belong.  
Innovation's cradle, whole,  
July marked a future goal.  

**Outro**  
A crucible of change, a hope to mend,  
Kusama sails through innovation's bend.
