**(Chorus)**  
In December '22, Kusama soared,  
Through blockchain skies, dreams restored.  
Canary cries in digital flight,  
Crafting futures in coded light.  

**(Verse 1)**  
Governance reborn, the stratosphere,  
Asynchronous paths becoming clear.  
Treasury's plans, a bold new dawn,  
Transaction flows, a world reborn.  

Parachains bidding, a vibrant dance,  
Turing's triumph, a new romance.  
Sakura paves the DeFi road,  
Cross-chain whispers, stories told.  

**(Chorus)**  
In December '22, Kusama soared,  
Through blockchain skies, dreams restored.  
Canary cries in digital flight,  
Crafting futures in coded light.  

**(Verse 2)**  
KSM's rise on turbulent tides,  
Peaking high where the value hides.  
Developers shape a brave new land,  
Zero-knowledge dreams, wisdom's hand.  

Roadmaps drawn for futures bold,  
Quantum-proof signatures unfold.  
Web3 vision in Kusamaâ€™s embrace,  
Innovation drives a rapid pace.  

**(Chorus)**  
In December '22, Kusama soared,  
Through blockchain skies, dreams restored.  
Canary cries in digital flight,  
Crafting futures in coded light.
