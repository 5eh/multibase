**Verse 1:**  
In the heart of '23, June spread its wings,  
Kusama's pulse, in the blockchain sings.  
OpenGov embraced, a revolution in line,  
The people decide, with no council to bind.  
Parachains paving the future bright,  
Tinkernet secured, through auction's light.  
Innovation whispers through every strand,  
Web3 beckons, a world unplanned.  

**Chorus:**  
Oh, Kusama, in June 2023,  
Riding waves of change, setting spirits free.  
With every auction and every vote,  
We carve our dreams, in code and hope.  
Oh, blockchain world, hear our song,  
In innovation’s arms, where we belong.  

**Verse 2:**  
Bootckathons roar, a developer’s delight,  
In Mexico City, dreams took flight.  
Rust and Substrate, in the coder's hands,  
Gears of Gear Protocol, molding lands.  
Zero-Knowledge whispers secrets to keep,  
On a post-quantum path, we leap.  
Amidst market sways, Kusama sails,  
With courage and vision, it never fails.  

**Chorus:**  
Oh, Kusama, in June 2023,  
Riding waves of change, setting spirits free.  
With every auction and every vote,  
We carve our dreams, in code and hope.  
Oh, blockchain world, hear our song,  
In innovation’s arms, where we belong.  

**Outro:**  
As tomorrow calls, we answer the plea,  
Kusama’s heart beats, eternally.  
In the landscape vast where dreams align,  
June painted futures, in blockchain’s sign.
