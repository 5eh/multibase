# Kusama News - August 2021

# "Kusama Welcomes New Parachains Amid Soaring Market Performance"

The fervent pace of growth and development at Kusama, Polkadot's experimental sister network, raged on throughout August 2021. The blockchain ecosystem welcomed a host of upgrades that are assisting the platform in maturing, resulting in progress in governance improvements, robust technical enhancements, and an escalation in the blockchain's ecosystem thanks to ongoing parachain auctions.

# OpenGov Implementation: New Staking Regulations Ensure Stability

Progressing admiringly, Kusama's governance updates became a central focus during August. As part of its commitment to maintain network stability amid a robust growth period, Kusama introduced new staking parameters, putting a temporary cap on the number of nominators active on the platform. The move was welcomed by many within the community. "This decision is a testament to Kusama's commitment to ensure network stability as we grow," noted one community member.

These developments emphasized Kusamaâ€™s dedication to its community-driven approach and its transparent conversation regarding the need for future adjustments to increase nominator capacity.

# Parachain Auctions: The Trigger for Blockchain expansion

In August, the spotlight was firmly on Kusama's ongoing parachain slot auctions. Upon the conclusion of the first round of auctions, which took place in June, five projects - Karura, Moonriver, Shiden, Khala, and Bifrost secured slots, proving the auctions' success. Further fuelling excitement within the Kusama community, the Kusama Council greenlit five additional auctions scheduled to kickoff on September 1st. A Kusama representative revealed, "This next set of auctions is a sign of Kusama's unrelenting growth and potential."

# Technical Developments: A Significant Push towards NFTs

August ushered in important technical changes for Kusama. The community rallied to approve an upgrade to the runtime of their Statemine parachain, allowing users to tokenize real-world assets and erect NFTs with just a 1 KSM deposit for every asset class. One Kusama developer was quoted saying, "This upgrade will encourage the representation of multiple real-world assets on Statemine."

# Market Performance: KSM Tokens Skyrocket

Kusama's native KSM token demonstrated robust performance in the market throughout August. Starting the month trading at around $200, KSM showcased impressive gains throughout August before peaking at $402.99 on September 2nd, an increase of almost 100%.

The market capitalization of Kusama also reflected its success, with steady increases in trading volume solidifying Kusama's position as one of the top 50 cryptocurrencies by market cap.

# Developer Ecosystem: Spotlight on Moonriver and Shiden Network

On the development frontier, Moonriver, a smart contract platform, cheered the completion of its launch sequence and went live on the Kusama network, while the Shiden Network, a multi-chain decentralized application layer, made notable progress towards full deployment.

# Looking Forward

As Kusama steps into September, the future outlook appears extremely promising. This experimental network, consistently at the forefront of technical advancement, seems poised to continue breaking new grounds, thanks to its upcoming parachain auctions and planned development upgrades. Acknowledging Kusama's progress, founder Gavin Wood commented, "Kusama exemplifies rapid iteration and community engagement, perfectly reflecting our vision."
